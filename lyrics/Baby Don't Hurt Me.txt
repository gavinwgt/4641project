21 ContributorsBaby Don’t Hurt Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
I want you for the dirty and clean
When you're wakin' in your dreams
When you bite my tongue and make me scream (And make me scream)
See, I got everything that you need
Ain't nobody gon' do it like me
We are burnin' at a high degree (Burnin' at a high degree)

[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
And you make me feel like it burns
And it hurts, uh
Maybe that's part of the rush
This is us

[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more

[Drop: Anne-Marie, Coi Leray]
What is love?
What is love?

I walk it, I talk it, I live it
What we do behind doors is our businеss
On my body, he givin' me kisses
I'm wеt when I'm with him, I pop it like Adderall
Baby, dive in my beach and go swimmin'
Let's go deep 'cause you know there's no limits
Nothin' stronger than you when I'm sippin'
I'm still gonna finish, I'm drunk, I ain't had enough
One day you here, then you ghost (Ooh)
Tellin' me lies and it's killin' me slowly (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Anne-Marie, Coi Leray]
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me (Yeah)
Don't hurt me (Mm) no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me (Yeah) no more (No more)

Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
What is love?
(Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da)

Hey, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Anne-Marie, Coi Leray]
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more (Yeah)
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
