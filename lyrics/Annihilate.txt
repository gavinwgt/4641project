(Metro)

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
I just came to my senses (Yeah)
I stay in another dimension
Fear is non-existent (Existent)
Suit up and swing through the city (Ooh, hey)
Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (Afraid)
I'm in my own world, give me space
I'm in my own universe, give me space (Space, yeah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Weezy Carter, I'm 'bout to go Peter Parker
I'm Spider-Man, if he ain't me, he just a creepy crawler
Tunechi spark the lighter, pull up in a new Ferrari Spider
Spider web necklace with the diamonds
She'll turn to Spider-Woman if I bite her
I will not go back and forth with you
I see you got the black widow with you
You should've had a black hero with you
I give an opp arachnophobia
I've been litty since I flicked the lighter
Since I was an itsy bitsy spider
They've been tryna wash the spider out
I got spiders crawlin' out your mouth, Spider-Verse

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Okay, we bounce and shake, we roll and rock
I got to set it straight, the block is hot
Something's come over me, I hit unlock
And tell my enemies, "I'll never stop"
No, no, nothing can shake me now
Tell the block I made it now
Yeah, the whole town is talking out
I swear, nothing can stop me now
All this, boosting all my senses
I won't start, but I finished
I shoot my shot, bet I won't miss it
Only way to go is go the distance
Nothing can shake me now
Nothing can break me down
Tell the whole town, we popping now
Nothing can shake me now
