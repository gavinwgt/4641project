11 ContributorsLove You Anyway Lyrics[Verse 1]
If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

[Pre-Chorus]
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

[Chorus]
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

[Verse 2]
I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There’s just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway

[Outro]
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anywayEmbed
