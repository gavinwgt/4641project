(We can't see from here right now)
I don't buy much, I buy land, bro
Cologne, Germany (Send it off from here right now)
Four McDonalds, every time I land, bro (Here right now)
Big Jay Rocks in both hands, bro, and all that (And free your mind)
And I'm best-dressed, movin' forward, yeah
Tiny Taz Arn', yeah, all that, Compton cowboy, all that
Yeah, big protein (And you w—, and you w—)
One-hundred and fifty grams of protein (Uh)
Y'all gotta stop playin', bro, I swear, bro

[Verse 1: Baby Keem & Bon Iver]
Uh, we gon' fuck up the world
Excuse me, but is that your girl?
If she tell, that's a good referral
Heebee-jeebie talk crazy to me, but Kendrick know I like irregular girls
I'm not good with the regular girls, damn near want a veteran girl
I just might change your life, we ain't wearin' no Giuseppe jeans
We ain't doin' none of normal things, do you know what formal means?
Critics sayin' that I lost the plot, principles, yeah, I'd rather not
Messi, 'bout to come in hot  (Please don't live in—, please don't live in fear)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Bon Iver]
'Dot, uh, we gon' fuck up the world (We can't see from here right now)
Excuse me, but is that your girl? (Here right now)
Didn't mean to possess your girl
Baby, I'm high-profile, don't ever tell 'em you met me, girl
(Send it off from here right now)
They gon' think that you rep me, girl, 5'7", I'm Messi, girl (Here right now)

I'ma pass you to Neymar, he got time for your bestie, girl
(We can't see from here right now)
Niggas know that I'm best-dressed, too high-profile to access (Here right now)
I ain't even gotta fact check, all I'm wearin' is Wales Bonner
(Send it off from here right now)
Feelin' good, I might wear no— (Here right now)
Matter of fact, let's stay platonic
I just fucked, ain't that ironic? You can pick the bunk or bed
Either way, I'ma want some head, Messi live through me instead
We grew up 'round triflin' hoes, you ain't did nothin' that I don't know
It's cool, baby, I'm too high-pro', I'm Baby Keem, I wouldn't call it close

[Refrain: Baby Keem & Bon Iver]
Messi, get them girls off the stage, 'cause somebody's gonna get taken
Somebody's gonna invade on a one-on-one conversation
I'm ducked off from the world, I'm immersed in the PlayStation (Please don't live in—)
And I ain't worried 'bout her, it's a thousand hers out waitin' (Please don't live in fear)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Bon Iver]
We gon' fuck up the world (Here right now)
Excuse me, but is that your girl? (Here right now)
Didn't mean to possess your girl
Baby, I'm high-profile, don't ever tell 'em you met me, girl (Send it off from here right now)
They gon' think that you rep me, girl, 5'7", I'm Messi, girl  (Here right now)
[Verse 3: Baby Keem, Bon Iver & Kendrick Lamar]
Famous, but I'm not for sale, why you tryna possess me, girl? (And free your mind)
I mean, you know what upset me, girl
Was like that when you met me, girl
'Cause he'll put you in princess shoes
Elevate you, respect you too
Here's ten K, I'm in a sexy mood
Don't let the homies touch you, move
Yeah, niggas know that I'm best-dressed
Wear Martine when I board jets
They sardines and I'm big fish, eat caviar when I'm depressed
Take selfies, I'm in Czech Republic, Cornell, he gon' check the budget
Borrowed two-million from my cousin, never gave it back, 'cause it's nothin'
Fuck it (Yeah), new devotions (Uh-huh)
Huh, keepin' focus (Please don't live in—)
Starship, is that a foreign? (Please don't live in fear, a foreign)
Huh, she's organic, skin is glowin', my heart is goin' (Like wow)
(We can't see from here right now)
Split personality, two phones, two emotions (Like how?)
Girl, you get the notion (Aroused), it's not hard to notice (Yeah, yeah)
(Send it off from here right now)
That's a deep, deep, deep, deep, deep ocean (That twat)
Shorty say she celibate, I'ma keep hopin' (And free your mind, she's not)
Shorty say she in love with me, I'ma be open (I'll try)
(And you w—, and you w—)
[Refrain: Baby Keem]
Messi, get them girls off the stage, 'cause somebody's gonna get taken
Somebody's gonna invade on a one-on-one conversation
I'm ducked off from the world, I'm immersed in the PlayStation
And I ain't worried 'bout her, it's a thousand hers out waitin'
[Outro: Bon Iver]
