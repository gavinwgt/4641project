6 ContributorsCowgirls Lyrics[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
She'll set the field on fire just cuttin' across a pasture
She'll have you fallin' for it all and then leave right after
And she got a cold heart but she got a warm smile
Cut from the same cloth, she kinda buck wild
Little bit angel, whole lotta outlaw
She's trouble but I'll tell you right now, y'all

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on thеm giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with somе good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls

[Verse 2: ERNEST]
I hate that I love the way them kisses taste like whiskey
How they wake up, take on off, and not even miss me
Leave this heart broken, holdin' that smokin' gun
I guess that's just the way them wild horses run
Let 'em run

Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on them giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with some good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen]
Come on, cowgirls
Don't you wanna take me away?
Lay me on down, girl
With the wild kind of lovin' you make
For God's sake

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen, Morgan Wallen & ERNEST]
Long live cowgirls
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on them giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with some good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirls
[Outro: Morgan Wallen]
Long live cowgirls
Yeah, long live cowgirlsEmbed
