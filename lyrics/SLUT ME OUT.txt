Gon' put this here in your kidney, please
And hush it like some kidney beans
Suck my balls, come chickpea me
Why you being weird to me? (Weird to me)
Put your ass in my face 'til I get pink eye
Fuck you anywhere, I'm that type guy (That type guy)
At the church, on the plane, at the basketball game

Promise that my nut taste like sugar gravy
Don't cum quick, I control my bladder (Control my bladder)

Fat coochies, little coochies, all coochies matter (They matter)
Ass real fat, I can make it get fatter (Fatter)

Coochie to my balls, dawg
