6 ContributorsNeed A Favor Lyrics[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

[Verse 1]
I know amazin' grace, but I ain't been livin' them words
Swear I spend most Sundays
Drunk off my ass than I have at church
Hard cover King James
Only been savin' dust on the nightstand
And I don't know what to say
By the time I fold my hands

[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

[Post-Chorus]
Amen, amen

Yeah, I owe you more than one
And beggars can't be choosers
But I'll pay for all I've done
Just pleasе don't let me lose hеr

[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

[Post-Chorus]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen

[Bridge]
Hangin' in there just barely
Throwin' up prayers like Hail Marys
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh, my God, oh, my God, Hail Mary
Hangin' in there just barely
Throwin' up prayers like Hail Marys
If You're still there, Lord, spare me
Oh, my God, oh, my God, Hail Mary
[Chorus]
I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So tell me, who the hell am I to expect a savior
When I only talk to God if I need a favor?
And, God, I need a favor

[Post-Chorus]
Amen
God, I need a favor
Woah
AmenEmbed
