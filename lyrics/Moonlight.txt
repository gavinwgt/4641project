I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

[Verse 1]
Forget the small talk
The surface level ain't much that I care for
Putting on my lip gloss
I saw you stare from my peripheral, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's been a hell of a day
But I know a place we can escape
Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free
When you're here with me

[Chorus]
I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

There's nothing like peace of mind
And you take the time to make sure that I'm okay
I know I can put stress on your brain
(You still love me, put no one above me)

[Pre-Chorus]
You always go out of your way
To show me that I'm your priority
Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free
When you're here with me

[Chorus]
I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo (I just wanna get high with my lover)
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
I just wanna get high with my lover (Get high)
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo (High with my lover)
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

[Outro]
Get higher with you
Get higher and higher with you
Let's go to the moon
And leave behind all that
How does it feel, here by my side getting higher and higher?
Under the moonlight's glow
There's nowhere we won't go
Together go higher and higher
No-no-nowhere we won't go5Embed
