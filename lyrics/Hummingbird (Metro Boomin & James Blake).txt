Metro
Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat

[Refrain: James Blake]
Hummingbird, summer song
Has it brought my life back?
Hangin' in the balance
Have you brought the light back?
Pen pal on a night shift
She's who I get away with
Realising she might
Be all I need in this life

[Verse 1: James Blake]
When I saw a cold snap
I wasn't with the season
Tag was on the ankle
And outside, there was a ceiling
In here, paper walls are
Pushin' back on you like
Eventually you push through
The moment that you realise

[Chorus: James Blake]
And hummingbird
I know that's our time (That's our time)
But stay on
Stay on, stay on with me
And hummingbird
I can never unsee
What you've shown me
Stay on, stay on with me

Hummingbird, summer song
Has it brought my life back?
Hangin' in the balance
Have you brought the light back?
Pen pal on a night shift
She's who I get away with
Realising she might
Be all I need in this life

[Verse 2: James Blake]
The moment when you realise
There's someone there that needs you
Lap band on the feelings
I tax them for no reason
I added love 'cause love is unconditional
I count on love, I count on love
'Cause love is unconditional within reason

[Chorus: James Blake]
And hummingbird (Hummingbird)
I know that's our time (I know that's our time)
But stay on (Stay on)
Stay on, stay on with me
And hummingbird (Hummingbird)
I can never unsee (Never)
What you've shown me
Stay on, stay on with me
[Bridge: James Blake]
Would I sign up again?
Would I sign up again?
And the night was so strong
Forget the time like life is long
Wings beating a thousand strong
Would I sign up again?
Would I sign up again?
And the night was so strong
Forget the time like life is long
Unconditional within reason

[Chorus: James Blake]
And hummingbird (Hummingbird)
I know that's our time (I know that's our time)
But stay on (Stay on)
Stay on, stay on with me (Stay on, stay on)
And hummingbird (Hummingbird)
I can never unsee (I can never)
What you've shown me (You)
Stay on, stay onEmbed
