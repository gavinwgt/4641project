Trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby

[Verse 1]
Picture a place where it all doesn't hurt
Where everything's safe and it doesn't get worse, oh my
We see through bloodshot eyes
Picture a place, somewhere else far away
Where you know what they mean and they mean what they say to us
And would that be enough?

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we running out of time?
Are we hiding from the light?
Are we just too scared to fight for what we want tonight?

[Chorus]
Closе your eyes and leavе it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby
You and I and everyone alive
We can run into the fire
It's a trust fall, baby
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby

We'll talk, then we'll cry, then we'll laugh 'til we're done, oh my
It's like we're out our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been running for our lives
We've been hiding from the light
We've been far too scared to fight for what we want tonight

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and leave it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby
You and I and everyone alive
We can run into the fire
It's a trust fall, baby
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby

[Bridge]
What if we just fall?
I'm not going without you
You're not going alone
I fell so far 'til I found you
But you know what you know when you know
So I'm not going without you
You're not going alone
'Cause you know when you know
[Chorus]
Close your eyes and leave it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby

[Outro]
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
