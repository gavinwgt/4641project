(Metro)
Just to save you
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Yo
I'd give my all
Hey

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
(Ooh) Just to save you, I'd give all of me (All of me, yeah)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (Callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (Fall)
So, to save you, I'd give my all (My all)
Just to save you, I'd give all of me (All of me)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (Callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (Fall for me)
So, to save you, I'd give my all (My all)

[Verse 1: NAV]
You fell for me, I count on you when times are tough
Instead of holdin' you down, I should lift you up
It hurts me when you start to see my flaws (My flaws)
But just to save you, I'd risk it all (All)
Short on time for you, I'd never havе enough (Have enough)
Whеn I ran into you, I didn't plan on fallin' in love
Always there to wipe your tears, I hate to see you cry
If you tell me to jump, I'll ask you, "How high?"
I know sometimes it be hard for me to tell the truth (Tell the truth)
But I go through any obstacle to get to you (To you)
I'm not materialistic, but I got a thing for you
Treat the world like my guitar, I'm pullin' strings for you

It's my fault, made you fall for me (Fall)
So, to save you, I'd give my all (My all)
Just to save you, I'd give all of me (All of me)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (Callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (Fall for me)
So, to save you, I'd give my all (My all)

[Verse 2: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Let me be your hero
You held me down, I was stuck at the bottom
Get out of here, I'll get you lit, oh
I know you can't stand me
I am the one that bust down your rose gold, had your diamonds dancin'
I picked you up in that Bentley Mulsanne, when them sirens was glarin'
I gave you this number, it's nobody else that got it, you can call me
The way I let you come into my life and take my heart away, it's like a robbery
Every time you look up on the charts, now, you seein' me, I hope you proud of me
I got you bussed down, Patek Philippes, ain't no way you goin' back to Cartis
And I splurge on her, she like "Saint Laurent me"
See me out in public, hardly
Low-key with my mask, I'm solo
If I don't speak to nobody, I'm sorry
And I'll save you if you can't save yourself
Hold on, let me catch my breath
Need a hero? I'm the last one left
[Chorus: Swae Lee]
(Ooh) Just to save you, I'd give all of me (All of me, yeah)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (Callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (Fall)
So, to save you, I'd give my all (My all)
Just to save you, I'd give all of me (All of me)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (Callin' me)
It's my fault, made you fall for me (Fall for me)
So, to save you, I'd give my all (My all)

[Outro: Swae Lee, Future, Young Thug & Brian Tyree Henry]
(For all the people)
(My all)
For all the people
My all
