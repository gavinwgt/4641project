41 ContributorsDial Drunk Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drowning your perspective out
So I ain't taking any fault
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
It's all the same anyways

[Chorus]
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that, when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'll die for you

[Verse 2]
I'm untethering from the parts of me you'd recognize
From charming to alarming in seconds
I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize
But, that's morning, I'll forget it
And the dial tone is all I have

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that, when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you
Well, I'd die for you

[Bridge]
Thank you, sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back
Oh, son, are you a danger to yourself?
Well, fuck that sir, just let me call
I'll give you my blood alcohol
I'll rot with all the burnouts in the cell
I'll change my faith, I'll kiss the badge
Just wait, I swear she'll call me back
Son, why do you do this to yourself?
And I said
[Chorus]
"I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know (I no longer know)
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that, when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you"Embed
