Type of time you on (Metro)
Chanel cover, it's on my mother
Hide in the mood
Type of time we on
(All the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live
All the way live, all the way live)

Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Seven differеnt days, yeah
365, all the way live, yеah
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on

Shave my back against the wall (Wall), I can't find no flaw (Flaw, flaw)
If I ever fall, I'ma take the fault (Yeah)
I can soar so high, don't need webs to crawl (Webs to crawl)
I can soar so high, don't need webs to crawl (Soar)
The world's in my hand, got powers in my palm (In my palm)
Look over the city, 'cause I'm on my own (Own)
Life can be so tricky, got my mind just gone (Just gone)
Got my mind (Go, go, woah)
Got no time for minglin', my senses tinglin' (Tinglin')
Every time I save the world, I think about my friends
I wish that I didn't have to pretend
But if I take my mask off, I blend in
You might also like
Type of time we on, type of time we on (Yeah)
Type of time we on, type of time we on (Let's go)
Seven different days, yeah
365, all the way live, yeah
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
(All the way live, all the way live, yeah)

Trackhawk with low suspension
Just so we can ride revengeful
High-performance, so expensive
My gang, we The Avengers
Solitaires, like Venom
Too many racks just stuck in my denim
All the way live, I swear we gon' get fast, hey
All the way live, I'm making you a habit
All the way live, 365
Seven days a week, we catchin' a vibe

Type of time we on, type of time we on (Yeah)
Type of time we on, type of time we on (Let's go)
Seven different days, yeah
365, all the way live, yeah
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Type of time we on, type of time we on
Got no time for minglin', my senses tinglin'
Every time I save the world, I think about my friends
I wish that I didn't have to pretend
But if I take my mask off, I blend in
I'm feelin' high, I'm feelin' high
I'm feelin' high, I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm—
I'm feeling high, I'm feeling high
I'm feelin' high, I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm—
You know you're supposed to catch the bad guys right?
I always do, usually3Embed
