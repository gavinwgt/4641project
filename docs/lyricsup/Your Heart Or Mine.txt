4 ContributorsYour Heart Or Mine Lyrics
All it takes is a downtown bar
All it takes is some neon stars
A little you, a little me
In the same vicinity and it's on
Everyone is the first last time
Walk away, then, we hit rewind
A little touch, a little buzz
Don't know what keeps keepin' it up

Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line?
Girl, we're playin' with fire
Love ain't too far behind
It's just a matter of time
'Til it finds your heart or mine

We say that it ain't no thing
We say it, then, the telephone rings
A hello, arе you at home
'Cause I'm all alone missin' you
Wе swear it ain't love, love, love
But you're there when the sun comes up
We swear it ain't love, love, love
But it always comes back to us

Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line?
Girl, we're playin' with fire
Love ain't too far behind
It's just a matter of time
'Til it finds your heart or mine


We swear it ain't love, love, love
We swear it ain't love, love, love

Is it your heart or mine?
Is it whiskey or wine?
Is it somethin' in the night
Makin' us wanna cross that line?
Girl, we're playin' with fire
Love ain't too far behind
It's just a matter of time
'Til it finds your heart or mine
Your heart or mineEmbed
