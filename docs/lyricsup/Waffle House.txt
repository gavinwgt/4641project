(Come on)

(Hey now) We never knew how to forfeit
(Hey now) But we always knew how to talk sh—
(Hey now) Couple nights, threw gasoline on the fire (Hey)
(Hey now) We never knew how to perfect
(Hey now) But we always knew it would work

'Cause if somethin' misread
Or if somethin' got said
Know before the night ends

No, don't get stressed, it's gon' get figured out
Oh, deep conversation at the Wafflе House
Headstrong father and a dеtermined mother
Oh, that's why some nights we tried to kill each other
But you know it's always love

(Hey now) We never knew how to fake it
(Hey now) But we always knew how to break sh—
(Hey now) Couple nights, threw gasoline on the fire
