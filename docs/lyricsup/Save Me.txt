16 ContributorsSave Me Lyrics
One, two, three

Somebody save me, me from myself
I've spent so long living in hell
They say my lifestyle is bad for my health
It's the only thing that seems to help

All of this drinkin' and smokin' is hopeless but feel like it's all that I need
Somethin' inside of me's broken, I hold on to anything that sets me free

I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams

What if the night sky was missin' the moon?
There were no shootin' stars, to use wishin' on you
And all of my sorrows, I'd just wash them down
It's the only peace, I've ever found

All of this drinkin' and smokin' is hopeless but feel like it's all that I need
Somethin' inside of me's broken, I hold on to anything that sets me free

I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams4Embed
