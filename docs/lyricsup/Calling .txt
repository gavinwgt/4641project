2 ContributorsSkyfall Pt2 Lyrics


Ooooh, ahhhh
Oooh, oooh, ahhh
Oooh, ahhhh
Oooh, oooh, ahh

My rap is unconscious
My watch is a 100, my whip cost 200
Gotta get a prescription, just to get served some muddy
Might shoot at yo buddy, who said he don't like me
The sky keep on fallin', the sluts I keep calling
They keep pickin' up for me, they love me
I don't wanna call oh no, it won't satisfy me, no
My rap is unconscious
My watch is a 100, my whip cost 200
Gotta get a prescription, just to get served some muddy
Might shoot at yo buddy, who said he don't like me
The sky keep on fallin', the sluts I keep calling

Yeah, that's the laugh shit, yeah
Ain't no joke nah, it's a diss
Pullin' up in my newest whip
Pickin' up, oh that's yo bitch
Hit the club with the shooters
Fuckin' it up then hoppin in the cruiser
I ain't tryna ball, why these niggas want me hoopin'?
Got her out of her morals, tryna get up to my jeweler
They just want me hanged, like a nigga from the future
Said I fucked the roommates yeah you know that's just a rumor
I'm so head of my time, could I show up any sooner?
Have you ever got stoned with your motherfuckin' tutor?
Scott La Flame, yeah he's a ruler
Yeah
You might also like
I don't wanna call no more
You ain't satisfyin' no more
My watch is 100, my whip cost 200
Might dive with a Rollie, Mariner with boulders
The sluts keep on ca-- My rap is unconcsious
Might dive with a Rollie, Mariner with boulders
The sluts keep on callin', the sky keep on falling
My watch is 100, my whip cost 200
Might dive with a Rollie, Mariner with boulders
Your wrist is fugazi, your shit is real shady
Why you act like you love me?
And the sky keep on fallin' and the sluts keep on calling
I don't wanna call no more
You ain't satisfyin' no more
My watch is 100, my whip cost 200
Might dive with a Rollie, Mariner with boulders
The sky keep on fallin', the sluts I keep calling

The sluts keep on callin'
The sky keep on fallin', the sluts keep on callin'
The sluts keep on callin'
The sky keep on fallin', the sluts keep on callin'
The sluts keep on callin'
The sky keep on fallin', the sluts keep on callin'
The sluts keep on callin'
The sky keep on fallin', the sluts keep on callin'
Look me inside of my eyes
All of this cash got me grippin yo thighs
I'm lit like La Flame's new single hit
Talkin watches, Uzi's the shit
Voting Kanye for president
Barbeque, no A1 shit
I'm a rapper but I ain't from the 6
Thugga whippin' turn a 2 to a 6
Reppin' gangs ain't really my shit
But still no respect for them crips
Fuck my school, never liked that principal
Never liked them niggas who too comfortable
Gossip like bitches how adorable
I got 300 hoodies and it's summer bro
My watch be shinin' with no flash no
Inside her pants issa miracle
I swear I fell in love with all of those

I don't wanna call no more
You ain't satisfyin' no more
My watch is 100, my whip cost 200
Might dive with a Rollie, Mariner with boulders
The sluts keep on ca-- My rap is unconcsious
Might dive with a Rollie, Mariner with boulders
The sluts keep on callin', the sky keep on falling
My watch is 100, my whip cost 200
Might dive with a Rollie, Mariner with boulders
Your wrist is fugazi, your shit is real shady
Why you act like you love me?
And the sky keep on fallin' and the sluts keep on calling
I don't wanna call no more
You ain't satisfyin' no more
My watch is 100, my whip cost 200
Might dive with a Rollie, Mariner with boulders
The sky keep on fallin', the sluts I keep calling
Metro Boomin' want some more nigga1Embed
