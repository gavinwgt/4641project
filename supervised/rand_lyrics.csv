/platters/,I Love You a thousand Times,/platters/i-love-you-a-thousand-times.html,"Remember love notes, the teacher found in school.
The whole class laughting, gee I felt just like a
fool.

But that's not the very part about I, I had to write
1 thousand times.

That I love you, I love you!
I love you, I love you!
Girl I love you, 1 thousand times.

The love notes I treasured, loving you was not a sin.
Punishment was pleasure, whoo Id do it all over again.

I wrote, and I wrote, till my fingers got sore,
But I had to write just a little bit more.

Did you read my letters its been on my mind?
All that it said was girl I love you one thousand times.

From then untile this very same day,
I still feel that same old way.

Till I'm six feet underground
You will always hear my sound, I'm breathing
I will always hold my own
They will judge and throw their stones
They will never steal my soul, I'm breathing
I am alive, I am alive, I am alive

I'll never hesitate
I'll never let you take
This kingdom that I've made
I alone survive
Don't need you telling me
That my life is just a dream
I'll beat my enemies
I alone survive
Yeah, yeah, I alone survive

I will never come undone
I'm the bullet in the gun
Hear my heart kick like a drum, still beating
Have I fallen in a dream
Full of pain and misery
I'll fly out and spread my wings while screaming
I am alive, I am alive, I am alive

I'll never hesitate
I'll never let you take
This kingdom that I've made

Don't need you telling me
That my life is just a dream
I'll beat my enemies

And as the sun rises
I'm faced with these choices
And it's always up to me
They won't destroy my dreams

Don't need you telling me

It's a world of bogus feelings and a world of slow decay,
It's a world of laughter hidden by this world of fear and torment,
It's a game of strange compulsion, our visceral convulsion:
Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain,
Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain.
Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man.
Foundation of society, anxiety. Suppress it if you can.
The caste of coffee achievers didn't perform like they planned.
The morning rush hour traffic is our play of false elan.
So run around your frantic track and lay you down to sleep;
Tomorrow's the redemption, we strive for that exception.
Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain,
Anxiety, a fear that you have nothing more to gain.
Anxiety destroys us but it drives the common man.
Foundation of society, anxiety. Suppress it if you can.
What are we angry for?
We all need a common cure.
That common goal for which you strive:
To have more than the other (have more than the other) guy.
The quest for truth, the quest for gold, yeah, we end up all the same
The common lie, the righteous cry, we end up all the same.
The angry crowd, those lost and found, everybody's all the same.

Anxiety for love of life, anxiety for pain,
Anxiety, a feeling that you know you can't contain.

I'm gonna cry you a river tonight

Boys baptised in wars
Morphine, chill scream, bad dream
Serving as numbers on dogtags, flakrags, sandbags
Your girl has married your best friend, loves end, poison pen
Your flesh will always creep, tossing turning sleep
The wounds that burn so deep

Your mother sits on the edge of the world
W when the cameras start to roll
Panoramic viewpoint resurrect the killing fold
Your father drains another beer, he's one of the few that cares
Crawling behind a Saracen's hull from the safety of his living room chwair
Forgotten sons, forgotten sons, forgotten sons

And so as I patrol in the valley of the shadow of the tricolour
I must fear evil, for I am but mortal and mortals can only die
Asking questions, pleading answers from the nameless faceless watchers
That stalk the carpeted corridors of Whitehall

Who orders desecration, mutilation, verbal masturbation
I in the guarded bureaucratic wombs

Minister, minister care for your children, order them not into damnation
To eliminate those who would trespass against you
For whose is the kingdom, the power, the glory forever and ever, Amen
Halt who goes there, Death, approach friend

You're just another coffin on its way down the emerald aisle
When your children's stony glances mourn your death in a terrorist's smile
The bomber's arm placing fiery gifts on the supermarket shelves
Alley sings with shrapnel detonate a temporary hell
Forgotten Sons

From the dole queue to the regiment a profession in a flash
But remember Monday signings when from door to door you dash
On the news a nation mourns you unknown soldier, count the cost
For a second you'll be famous but labelled posthumous

Forgotten sons, forgotten sons
Peace on earth and mercy mild, Mother Brown has lost her child
Just another Forgotten Son

Forced from their homes, driven from their land, survival by chance in the... march of the damned! battered and beaten yet they try to stand, they must move on in the... march of the damned!

Prisoner of war, captured at the front, in the rubble you bore the brunt. marched into the streets in humiliating defeat, being spat upon, cursed upon, kicked and beat.

Sent to siberia, morale is getting low, will you ever see your family, will you ever see your home. you've got to hold on, you've got to keep faith, for your spirit and body they're trying to break.

You swore the oath to your fatherland, now herded like cattle in the... march of the damned! honor and dignity the foe can't understand, they weren't in your place in the... march of the damned!

These are victims that time had forgot, bombed, beaten, and left in gulags to rot. they stood accused, accused by the blind, believing in their land was their only crime.

Some call it loyalty, some call it treason, what is a world that can not see reason. how can one cast blame upon a nation, when victors lies breed humiliation.

Holding me feelin' you
Could you go and break my heart?

She wanna pillowfight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spyin' again

She wanna roll wit Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight wit lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna respect the rest, kick me to the curb
if she find one strand a hair longer than hers

She want
make love in the Jacuzzi
Rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib,
keys to da newbie

She wanna
answer the phone
tatoo her arm
last one I got her

She call me Heartbreaker

[vocal patterns: Fisher, Webster]

The basement incinerator
Is where they'll put the head
Hose the floor and clean the room
Anywhere they bled

Into boxes go the bags
Fill the space with rocks
In the dark of night
He throws them off the docks

Rotting in the river
Never to be found
Under tons of concrete
Deep beneath the ground

From behind he grabs his mouth
The blade goes to his neck
Bulging veins pumping blood
He struggles to protect

If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat

The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks

Grab the neck, Slit the throat, take the life
Hang the corpse - Prepare to drain the blood

Bone saw, meat cleaver, filleting knife
Carve the corpse - Dissect him in the tub

Smash the teeth, slice off scars, crush the bones
With a crowbar - scrape off all tattoos

If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat

The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks

Chunks of a skull
Sawn in half bones
Body is found
Killer unknown

Rizz up like your with us if not zip up
You lip up whip up.

Try to satisfy the cravings before they
Consume you

Colours are brighter
The world can excite you
When you’re under its spell
You can tell
All too well
That without it life would be hell

And time is passing you by
It marks no moment of your life
When you submit yourself to be numb,
The fear disappears,
And everything seems clear

When the emptiness is upon you
It fills you up like a balloon
And you float
High up over the real world,
And think of when
You were a little girl again

Where would you go, baby?
What could you do?
Didn’t you hear, baby?
Nothing is sure but uncertainty

You can feel the hunger inside you
But the longing will no longer guide you onwards,
Sinking into the floorboards
Where the rats eat at your will
And do it until,
Your belly aches
And your soul will not be still

Wrench yourself from your demons
For far too long you’ve believed them
When they told you you were weak
Take a step in the tunnel
With the light ’round the bend
In the end
You can start to make amends
Who knows where you’ll go, baby
So much you could do!

Hey, Porter, Hey Porter!
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be
'Til we cross that Mason Dixon Line?
At daylight will you tell that engineer to slow it down;
Or better still, just stop the train
'Cause I want to look around.

Hey, Porter! Hey Porter!
What time did you say?
How much longer will it be
'Till I can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer to ring his bell;
And ask everybody that ain't asleep to stand right up and yell.

Hey, Porter! Hey Porter!
It's getting light outside.
This old train is puffin' smoke and I have to strain my eyes.
But ask that engineer if he will blow his whistle please,
'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves,
And I smell that Southern breeze.

Hey, Porter! Hey, Porter!
Please get my bags for me,
I need nobody to tell me now that we're in Tennessee.
Go tell that engineer to make that lonesome whistle scream.
We're not so far from home so take it easy on the steam.

Hey Porter! Hey Porter!
Please open up my door.
When they stop this train I'm gonna get off first
'Cause I can't wait no more.
Tell that engineer I say, ""Thanks a lot. I didn't mind the fare.
I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil
And breathe that Southern air.""

I thought I met a man who said he knew a man
who knew what was going on
I was mistaken, only another stranger that I knew

And I thought that I found a light to guide me through the night
and all this darkness
I was mistaken, only reflections of a shadow that I saw

And I thought I'd seen someone who seemed
""at last"" to know the truth
I was mistaken, only a child laughing in the sun, in the sun

To be fearful of the consequences

Decreed is the sentence
Her prophetic downfall

To burn it all, this opulent splendor
And cast her down in naked surrender

Festers and shines there

Upon Eden's forbidden tree

Black smoke curling from the lips of war

Feeling his way through darkness
This priceless treasure
For which Iâ€™ve searched
Appeared to me nothing more
Than a mirage in the sea

But when the vision faded
From this struggle and dream
Suddenly my illusion is diarry
Iâ€™ve now discovered whatâ€™s reality

Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
Iâ€™ve found you
Even if youâ€™re only
Even if youâ€™re only
Even if youâ€™re only

I'm gonna expose yo ass you bitch...
See me in these motherfuckin' streets (don't stop), with ya fag ass
Gangsta Walk, yeah right, ya pussy...

[Verse 1]
Look out, we everyday grinding
Everybody in the North gotta love us down South 'cause we blindin'
And we don't trip the big diamonds
We mainly focus on the old schools with big blocks lying
And I been around the world in one day
Chucking up the duece for S.A.
I'm a hood cat, and that's for searching me a hood rat
With good cat, something beautiful to look at, fa sho
I kick it for my niggaz in the ghetto
And all my homies in the federal-
Lock up, behind the wall setting shop up
They beat the block up, yet and still they couldn't stop us
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta back at it
Cause I'm the last of the Dons, God damm it
I hear ya talking, but I don't cater to the chit-chat
But when I see you in the streets I got ya get back (word)
It ain't enough protection on ya ass, to fuck wit Brad
I got a lesson for ya ass
I showed ya, the Southside niggaz tote heat
I showed ya, the Northside niggaz roll deep
Ya weak, 'cause I'm the biggest fish in the pond
And when I say the magic word, bitch ya gone
Assassinated, people lay steppin'
Eliminated, enemy with aggression
Sit back and smoke me one
The Obi Won Kenobi one
Fuck the champagne sippin', woodgrain grippin'
I'm spittin' for the Vice Lords, gangstas and Crips and Bloods
And everybody neighborhood
From the Idery Wells, back down to Inglewood
How can a nigga from the South get a pass in every section
And walk the projects with no protection
Be surrounded by a mob, and not get robbed
Considered to be a savior, and not be God (Whoa)
Listen to the nigga flow now
I can speed it up or slow down
Face the facts baby, I got it locked like this and like that baby
Southern rap/rock baby
The last of a dying, we born again
The vicous life religous, I was born to win
The closoure after the greatest hit the sofa
When I still ride for Prince like a soldier
The two-thousand millenium comes
Since I'm the son of the father, that makes me the Don
The next up to bat, the Jordan, larry, cousy yo of rap
And I ain't gotta walk around strapped
J don't tollorate the mack dirties
You in our motherfucking way, we tryin' to stack 30s
Now back it up, for he send something back to you
Ain't plan to defend
Staying loyal to the Prince to the end, so recognize

So what you gone do Face? (Play till I win)
So what you gone do? (Double back and do it again)
So what you gone do Face? (I'm a play the game 'til I win)
So what you gone do? (Play till I win)
So what you gone do Face? (Play till I win)
So what you gone do? (Double back and do it again)
So what you gone do Face? (Play the game 'til I win)

[Verse 2]
So here it is fool, I play the game where it's no rules
Dropped out in the 10th grade and told my mom to fuck school!
'Cause they ain't teach a nigga shit, I learned to read when I was 5
And plus I been smart a long time
Fuck a history test, I'm more concerned about respect
I make my moves in an L like a night nigga check
It's on 'til the break of dawn, I keep it on
And on and on, and on and on and on and on
Like clockwork, we hit these niggaz where it hurt
Knock they dicks in the dirt
Now you the bitch that's in the skirt
I'm passed the motherfucka out here paying his dues
Not the average nigga out here rapping claiming he true
I just stick to the script and take it in stride
Get my daily dose of game from James and take it and ride
Yes yes y'all, funky fresh and in the flesh y'all
This time I'm aiming at the neck dog
It ain't no ducking when I'm bustin', I'm a leave you a nice-
Little whole in ya throat, releavin' ya life
I'm going out with a bang, letting my nuts hang
I'm outty like flame, the signature just James, recognize

In '61, long brown hair, foolish eyes

He looks just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American Prince
A blue jean serenade, and moon river
what you do to me
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was looking for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a palm tonight

Change came in disguise of revelation
set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around
And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
Drawbridges closing

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was looking for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrapping up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown

I saw the ending when they turned the page
I took my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of the great divide

Out where the dreams are high
Out here, the wind don't blow
Out here, the good girls die
And the sky won't snow

Out here, the birds don't sing
Out here, the fields don't grow
Out here, the bell don't ring
Out here, the bell don't ring

Out here, the good girls die

Now Cinderella, don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Oh don't you know, the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you

Or did you leave it back in 61?

Mama singing my my side
Daddy there standing by
Took a while for I to see
Exactly what your giving me
Now that I'm woman grown making
Heads turn on my own

And nobody's gonna bring me down
Aint nobody who can touch me now
Cuz nobody else has got what I've got
Nobody else gonna make it this hot
My words, my rythm, have you heard what I'm giving

Uh uh you on the dancefloor
Can you ride on my tempo
Uh uh you in the yard
Are we making you sweat
Uh uh up on the pavement
Are you feeling this tempo
Uh uh it aint hard
We gonna ride it trough the night

So now your feeling my style
Is breaking down for a while
We got you running for miles and I'll tell you why
Taking you for a trip so let you back bone slip
Lick your lip double dip baby moove your hip
Wanna take you away
From the pain let me say everyday
Aint the same as yesterday
Cuz life is gritty and dark in the city
Uh ah what a pitty
Better leave i all behind

He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate tell me it's right
is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

So we found this hotel
it was a place I knew well
We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke
all I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

Oh, ooh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day, we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
when he saw his own eyes
I said please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me
Ohh, oh, oh was the one little thing that you can

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Say you will baby, you want me too

All night long

All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you

Take the load off your mind
Have a drink, tell me your ancient stories
Make them strong, no guts no glory
There’s a tough road ahead of us
But right now we are fine

Tell me how you want it

Truth comes from within, no one will send it
If we don’t talk you wouldn’t call us friends

This is seventh heaven
I don’t mean from up above

It all comes down to love

Nothing ever is perfect
Everything blows with the wind, it ain’t easy
But with real friends I don’t feel weary
And all things turn around
We might just win
Life has good and bad incorporated
Moves on the road with kicks and pins
We all play our part, but right now
Our thirst needs to be quenched

What you can’t carry, you can leave here
Pass it on to the ones that you endear
That bright shiny lightness in your heart

""Yeah... uh huh...""

[Verse 1]
I'm caught up inside a tornado and sucked in
By a rainstorm holding a hairdryer that's plugged in
Somewhere between the Renaissance Center and 8 Mile
Inside the Rock City that has spawned a unique child
And lightening strikes twice I was hit when they birthed me
And now I gotta live with this mouth that they cursed me
They said I gotta use it with tracks and try to fuse it
Don't abuse it and don't ever let 'em crack on your music
So I sit and watch the people that do it and don't pursue it
And instead I jot a little bit down then go review it
I just wait until I'm ready to leap and jump into it
Until I feel a little more confident I can do it
Not so many years later I've waited and now I'm here
To release a masterpiece on everybody in fear
I ain't holding nothing back in a world that's full of evil
My words can only injure or hurt so many people
I'm here to trade spaces shatter and blade faces
With guitars and bass lines and embrace and break stages
The pain'll come in phases for now it's just outrageous
When I'm knocking hear me cocking my gauge cause I'm impatient

[Chorus]
From the Motor City...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word on down)
Down to New Orleans...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
From the penitentiary...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
To the criminals roaming the streets...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming

[Verse 2]
I've waited so long to unleash on these streets
A diary with more fury in sprees than Alicia Keys
My words are mere visions of movies with non-fiction
Intertwined in each rhyme that I spit with sweet diction
The rest are so pathetic and best are copasetic
By the time it hits you dead in the chest I hope you get it
I'm out to break laws slice and break jaws
Or I'll be on your stage with an axe and chainsaws
Of course my pains raw my brain is off a little
Ever since the first time I could rhyme and solve a riddle
Simon says go ahead and block the silence
And fuck with anybody who says to stop the violence
Go run and tell your parents I'm evil and I'm the devil
When it's gonna take a nation of mil to stop a rebel
Cause now it's all over I'm crazy and even zany
Lyrically Scorsese on a track by Mr. Shady

[Chorus]
From San Diego...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
All the way back to Queens...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
This ain't a rumor...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
Remember you heard that from me...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming

[Verse 3]
My behavior gets erratic on tracks that got static
When I spit the bullets just keep coming it's automatic
I'm ill it's been said every letter I let sink
And left 'em dead inside a puddle of songs with red ink
I played away shy since the day I stayed high
And staged dive from the top of my roof at age 5
My mother always said that her son was gonna make it
If he wasn't gonna make it he'll have to go and take it
So now I'm on Geffen the whole world is trippin'
Cause another new MC from the D is off and flippin'
And this one's Lebanese do we have to say the bomb
Is he related to Osama Bin Laden or Saddam
I'm just a suicidal bomber on tracks and always killin'
Everything that ever gets in my way and such a villian
If you think you know me now then get ready because I'm grinning'
This ain't even near the end of Omega it's just beginning'

[Chorus]
From the City of Angels...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
To the streets of Mississippi...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
(I said you can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming
For the players that's hatin'...
(Let 'em know that) Hush Is Coming
(You ain't heard spread the word)
You better start clearing the street...
(You can tell 'em that) Hush Is Coming

I used 2 have mad sex in the horny morning
I used 2 have mad sex in the afternoon
I used 2 have mad sex when me and this mulatto go down
2 dirty up another room

Do it till your tattoo's dizzy
And the stud in your mouth turns gold
Till the animal prints U flaunt so lovely
Is full of little bloody holes

Steppin' up on the others tryin' 2 make a jealous brotha
Get U nothin' but another night of vibration
One nation under your groove and still U can't break my cool

Once again the talk of the town
Break another heart, U sorry... skench!
One day U're gonna tumble down, down, down, down

And U never really knew my name (What good is time)
What good is time if U take up (What good is time if U take up)

In any country, prison is where society sends it's failures
But in this country, society itself is failing.

Verse One:

Today, how you like me now, I'm in the mix?
It's 1986 and I got the fix with the chicken and a quota
Got the baking soda, let the water boil, workers all loyal
Dropped out the twelveth
Cuz my wealth is shorter than a midget on his knees
Now I slang keys
Infest my hood with crack, cuz I'm the mack
Take a nation of millions to hold me back
Too big for my britches, and I got bitches
Now I'm hittin' switches, niggas want my riches
Used to get 18 when my G was alive, now a key is 13-5
'89s the number, another summer
Police ain't get no dumber
Streets dried up, used to think it would last
But being a king-pin is a thing of the past
They tried to blast me for selling a boulder
Now I got my ass in Minnesota
Got my own crew, it's on brand new

Damn, what can I do?

Today...

Verse Two:

Already done stack me half a mill ticket
Bought a house next to Prince, so now I can kick it
Now I got ends, wavin' to my friends, rollin' in my Benz
Goin' to see the Twins, play at the dome
Police are tappin' my mobile phone
I'm almost home
Gettin' excited, indited, spent a grip and a year tryin' to fight it
Lawyer got paid, plea, no contest
And everything I own got repossessed
Now take a look at the dust
And I'm happy cuz I only got 36 months
Never picked up a book
But my arms are 16 inches, niggas look
Can't wait for '92 so I can get with my crew
And see, what can I do?

Today...


Verse Three:

Phucked up in the pen, now it's ninety-fo
Back in LA, and I'm bailin' in the dough
Everybody, now I gotta start from scratch
So where to work at, and niggas smirk at
Me say ain't nuttin' poppin from here to the LB
What you tell me?
No it ain't crack, and everybody's jackin' for a coupe
Cuz, they sent in the troops
Even tho I got muscle, that ain't my hustle
Takin' niggas sh*t in a tussle
No skills to pay the bills
Takin' 'bout education to battle inflashion
No college degree, just a dumb ass G
(Yeah you Nigga, who me?)
I got a baby on the way, damn it's a mess
Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes
Took some advice from my Uncle Fester
All dressed up in polyester
Welcome to McDonalds may I please help you?
sh*t, what can I do?

Today...

Call me curious and I wont blame you for trying to cut me out
Your head is full of doubt my mouth is full of blood.

And no one down,

But I would get caught up on how it used to be
And find you leaving would drive me crazy
I wont get cut off following your lead
If half of the world comes crashing down on me.

I know a thing know a thing about sadness
I know how it feels how it feels to be alone
Just hold me tight yeah your the thorn in my side
Till you go through it yourself you'll never know.

I'm not good enough I'll just
Spare you the details I'm making up
And I wont need you to ever come around
Here your everything I fear
The criminal stealing all my hope.

But I wont get caught up on how it used to be
To find you leaving would drive me crazy
I wont get caught up following your lead.

And even if I do you will only tell me.

I know a thing know a thing about sadness
Know how it feels how it feels to be alone
Just hold me tight yeah your the thorn in my side
Till you go through it yourself you'll never know.

My heart sinks down in to my stomach
It's the taste of the end even if I don't want it
My eyes close don't know what I'm becoming
Just a shadow of the person that I was before.

You can use my bones.

You can use my bones.

If you want to put me back together again.

I know a thing know a thing about sadness
Know how it feels how it feels to be alone
Just hold me tight yeah your the thorn in my side
Till you go through it yourself you'll never know.

I know a thing know a thing about sadness.

Dont you cry, dont you fret,
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken,
and your blues will be foresaken,
Some lucky day lovely love will come your way.

If there is love in your heart to share,
Dear Bluesette don't despair
Some blue boy is waiting just like you'
To find a someone to be true to,
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay.

Get set, Bluesette,
True love is coming,
Your lonely heart soon will be humming.

Pretty little Blusette,
Musn't be a mourner,
Have you heard the news yet,
Love's 'round the corner.
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons
To make your next springtime
Your gold weding ring time.

He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee
He married Virgin Mary, the Queen of Galilee

Mary and Joseph walked through an orchard green
There were berries and cherries, as thick as might be seen
There were berries and cherries, as thick as might be seen

When Mary said to Joseph, so meek and so mild
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child
Joseph, gather me some cherries, for I am with child

Then Joseph flew in anger, in anger flew he
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!
Let the father of the baby gather cherries for thee!

Then up spoke baby Jesus, from in Mary's womb
Bend down the tallest tree, that my mother might have some
Bend down the tallest tree, that my mother might have some

Then bend down the tallest branch, it touched Mary's hand
Cried she, oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command
Oh look thou Joseph, I have cherries by command",en

In the fall of those who fought
The evolution of the kill
More precision more refined

Desprate stages, chaos reigns

How do you feel, that is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of hope
So while you're outside looking in describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

An epidemic of the mannequins contaminating everything
When thought came from the heart
But never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises
(null and void instead of voices)
Before you tell yourself
It's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home

The stars that lie to you

And beg forgiveness
Plead with you

Cover it all up with lies

That I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
That you've already
Gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more

Now I would do most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just
Keep on laughing

I just discovered why the world is round
Round in a circle my arms will be
And doing the same as you
It ain't right it's only for you and me
Only the lonely so it seperately
Keep it alive on the food of love
But only the chosen few

Any child that clings to childish things
is trying to let go
And up to now

Now my world starts to glow
Like a stained-glass window
And what was old and cold
Is warm and new.
And so you see
Why I can never be
Away from you.


Away from you
The world is lifeless
As though creation
Has gone awry.
The trees are bare,
There are no flowers,
The fields are thirsty,
The streams are dry.


We live, you and I,
For a breath of sunlight,
So brief an escape
From a world of gray.
Our moments of warmth
Have been touch and go, love,
But tonight, we'll touch
And stay.


The people I meet
Might as well be statues,
The words we exchange
Might as well be Greek.
The room that I'm in
May be bright and cheerful
But to me
It's dim and bleak.


I'm half alive
Until the moment
The door swings open
And you walk through.
Now my soul is afloat
On a wave of music
That I could feel such joy
I never knew.
And so you see
Why I can never be
Away from you.

And spend our nights so bon vivant.
We dress our days in silken robes,
The money comes, the money goes...
We know it's all a passing phase.

We light our lamps for atmosphere,
And hang our hopes on chandeliers.
We're going wrong, we're gaining weight,
We're sleeping long and far too late.
And so it's time to change our ways...
But I've loved these days.

Now as we indulge in things refined,
We hide our hearts from harder times.
A string of pearls, a foreign car...
Oh, we can only go so far... on caviar and Cabernet.

We drown our doubts in dry champagne,
And soothe our souls with fine cocaine.
I don't know why I even care...
We get so high and get nowhere.
We'll have to change our jaded ways...
But I've loved these days.

So before we end (and then begin)-
We'll drink a toast to how it's been...
A few more hours to be complete,
A few more nights on satin sheets,
A few more times that I can say...

""Hey, come to Los Angeles!
You and your family can have peace and tranquility.
Enjoy the refinement..""
""Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?""
""Hello, my name is Elaine --
and I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles""

[Ice Cube]
How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove comparment
cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
but if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
and don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
on stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive

""Hi this is Elaine again.
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles,
or is somebody taking your things? Have you witneesed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
to witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police,
so you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again.""
""This is Los Angeles."" ""This is Los Angeles.""

[Ice Cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
cause most niggaz get got
in either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed-off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a section eight
cause if so that's a monkey-wrench hoe
and you won't survive in South Central

""Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be.
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV.
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on;
punk motherfucker!""

And you need your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill
Sir Jinx, aiyyo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God damnit!

[Ice Cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggaz are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a vice
on everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
We discern
cause South Central L.A., is one big yearn
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
and start slangin ki's
to an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A. heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
they live behind bars
So everybody's doin a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
as you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central

Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass,
you tramp-ass hoes? You better watch out.
And for you so called baller-ass niggaz,
you know what time it is. South Central ain't no joke.
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers.
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god damnit.
You'll sho' get got, just like that.
This ain't no joke motherfuckers.
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer,
puttin his two cents in..

I can't wash the pain from my tortured mind
With the gay crowd and the music and the bright light that shine
If this makes you happy I don't blame you if you go
You've turned to a stranger that I hardly know
The glamor of the night life can't lure me away
I'd rather sit waiting and long for the day
You'll return with your love that's faded so slow
No longer a stranger that I hardly know",en

Steel of the brave hearts trapped inside
In frozen of illusion
High is the mountain we must climb
Reach out for rebellion

Rise up to the open sky
One chance at the price of glory
Fire in a thousand blazing skies
One lifetime ascending
Strong is an army, side by side
Still brave and defending

March on through the tragic lands
Cold tears in the north wind falling
Raise your souls high
See the new dawn arise through the

Sands of all time, mystery of life
Everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by
Land lost in time, once more back where we belong
Promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on

Silent and twisted, lifeless mind
So blind in delusion
Cursed by the emptiness inside
Cast out in confusion

Strike back with the power in hand
Break free from a past life, dying
Onwards we strive till
The answers we'll find in the

Sands of all time, mystery of life
Everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by
Land lost in time, once more back where we belong
Promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on

Still lost alone and I'm dying
Daylight the world is still crying
Evermore we'll search throughout a lifetime

Stars are falling down tonight,
Light the path where eagles fly
Find the strength inside us, a new world reborn
Silent tears of pain we cried,
Raise our hands unto the sky
Break the chains that bind us,
One moment in time as we

Rise up to the open sky
One chance at the price of glory
Raise your souls high
See the new dawn arise through the

Sands of all time, mystery of life
Everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by
Land lost in time, once more back where we belong
Memories of life to pray for
Everlasting price to pay for
Promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on

Sands of all time, once more we'll rise up again

When I was a boy
I'd get so annoyed
Whenever it was pouring rain
Standin' at the glass door
Starin' at the outside nose pressed against the pane
I told my momma
I don't wanna be stuck inside no more
Give me thunder and lightnin', somethin' excitin'
That's what I'm livin' for

There's a world out there and I wanna be in it
I got a life and I'm gonna live it
Don't tell me the sky's the limit
There's footprints on the moon
I wanna do my walkin' down the road less traveled
Sew my dreams where they won't unravel
If you play it safe you won't get nowhere
I can't stay in here when there's a world out there

I remember back in school
They thought I was a fool
For askin' Lizzy Walker to the dance
She was always with the captain of the football team
Nobody thought I even have a chance
But imagine my surprise
When she looked me in the eyes
And said I'll go with you instead
I knew we'd be together for the rest of forever
When Lizzy looked at me and said
Hey baby

There's a world out there and I wanna be in it
I got a life and I'm gonna live it
Don't tell me the sky's the limit
There's footprints on the moon
I wanna do my walkin' down the road less traveled
Sew my dreams where they won't unravel
If you play it safe you won't get nowhere
I can't stay in here when there's a world out there

I imagine when they land on a brand new planet
In some far off galaxy
Somebody in the rocket's gonna look out the window
Feeling just like Lizzy and me

There's a world out there and I wanna be in it
I got a life and I'm gonna live it
Don't tell me the sky's the limit
There's footprints on the moon
I wanna do my walkin' down the road less traveled
Sew my dreams where they won't unravel
If you play it safe you won't get nowhere
I can't stay in here when there's a world out there

If you play it safe you won't get nowhere
You can't stay in here when there's a world out there

We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
When the earth quakes we'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the World united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the World connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along

This transcription comes from the song Tombstone Eyes
played on July 26, 1996 in Toronto, Ontario.
The lyrics will vary from show to show because they are not
set in stone yet, but this is what Dickey sang on July 26.

Transcribed by Nathan Yerg


INTRO: G C G DCG
(G)Not so long ago, just a (C)few years back
(G)We used to hang out down by the (C)railroad track.
(G)The guitars they played and the (C)singers made rhyme
(D)It was a good time for being free. G C G C

(G)Bouquet of flowers on her (C)kitchen window sill
(G)Listen to Bob Dylans new stuff (C)he'd just done in Jacksonville
(G)Lay down on the hillside and (C)look up at the sky
(D)We had it all you and I. G C G C

(G)And the lives we were living started to (C)feel like yesterday
(G)People started driftin and (C)goin their separate ways
(G)The wind started blowin and the (C)sky began to cry
(D)You and I we didnt make it, I wished we'd never said goodbye

Chorus:
(C)I hope I never (D)see those eyes (G)again
(C)Eyes that used to (D)be my best (G)friend's
(C)And we gave it all (D)away for the (G)diamonds in the (Em)dust
(C)With a hungry voice still howlin in the (D)wind
(C)A heart of stone no (D)longer lasts, her (G)eyes no longer (Em)cry
(C)I know I'll never (D)see those (C)tombstone (D)eyes again. G DCG

When she hears her lifeline crying
Not a thing you say can stop her
When she just can't stop herself

I remember that July, the panic and the heat
The savage shine of summer, the strychnine in the street
The way they sold each other for a favor in glassine
The best of friends sold brothers for a dime of quinine dreams

Well stick with me, do as I does, and be as I be

We be stackin chips, packin clips, mackin chicks
Laugh at tits, slappin dick, in yo' bitch (bitch!)
Makin hoes, take these clothes, from these sto's
Walkin slow, there go the po', now here we go
Parking lot to the spot, Marriott
Cause what I got to make a knot, is very hot
Who's at the do', go and check, I got the Tec
Tell him that you soakin wet, until he jet
Now lift up your fuckin dress, where's the rest
Bitch can hide a treasure chest, in her breasts
Uh-huh strip search, whip skirts
Uh-huh shit hurts, but it works bitch
You can jerk niggaz but you can't jerk me
Hoe I only tell you once that this dick ain't free
I'm talkin greed

Greed, give me everything that I need
How you gon' deal with the niggaz that I feed

We smokin weed, you and me
Lookin for that currency

Now bitch niggaz don't mean shit, from where I sit
Magnificent blow your back out, if you act out
Eighteen deep when the plane soar
The bitch threw her tits asked my click who we pay for
Penetrate the clouds, loud, and obnoxious
Surround the airport with feds and helicopters
Escorted, detained and deported
Scared of the ly-rics, and when they bitches hear us
We the clear-est, you can fear us
Smile on the day of your dissapear-ance, smoke in mirr-ors
Break em all, pull over and jump out
Cause I can take em all, all bustas shake em all
I'm at the mall, buyin shit, like hot dog on a stick
These bitches all on the dick
Ice Cube ain't a lick (nope) make me bleed
And now you got to deal with the niggaz that I feed, greed
Uhh uhh uhh *pigs squeal*
(Give me more, give me more) Greed, Greed

When you get your hands on it, wanna fawn it
Wanna dance on it, everybody want it
(repeat 2X)

You punks is petty, still we steady, countin fetti
I'm the one closin escrow, with the best flow
(Do you wear a vest?) No
Niggaz hit me I'ma turn into The Crow *caw caw* and take a shit
on everything counterfeit, the Don Mega
Blade Runner, in a beige Hummer all summer
It'd take about twelve honkeys, to convict
the nigga makin you sick, ask the 12 Monkeys
Up in Detroit holdin weed court, all through the South
Picked up a ounce in Shreveport
My lead give head tunnels (boom!)
to any motherfucker disgruntled exit wound, look like a funnel
Worldwide, international jet set
My niggaz love fuckin bitches that they just met
Get it wet, and you can do anything
When I'm in Paris niggaz french-kiss the pinky ring

Yeah, Ice Cube, trillionaire
I own a mansion and a yacht, haha

Yeah, Westside niggaz is very greedy, uhh

And you think maybe you've had enough

Everything we ever felt was true
As we find the years behind us and we live the years ahead
Let's remember laughter and all the words we said


Make new friends and keep the old
One is silver and the other one's gold

I have lost my wife and children

Kept us hidden in a garrett
And then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper

There were three of us this morning

And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant

any lust that burned within me

And when I die alone, when I die alone
when I die I'll be on time

were a birth and a divorce

so I'll play my part

But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind

Alone its song will fail, thus the Earth shall turn to Ash...

Oh chosen one! Chosen one... You are the chosen one!
Oh chosen one! Chosen one...

Into thine hands, bring together all three...
The treasures combined tamed the beast of the sea...
(Ah, ah-ah, ah...)

From the trio of islands...
Ancient spheres shall you take...
For between life and death...
All the difference you'll make...

Oh chosen one! Chosen one... You are the chosen one!
Oh chosen one! Chosen one...

Climb to the shrine...
To right what is wrong...
And the world will be healed...
By the guardian song...

Underneath a coat of rust she was gold

Read in the Bible what's written there'll one
Day come true 'bout the end of the world and
All life and all things that we knew
The reaper is sharpening his scythe
This is the end of your body
And day will be night

The sun will fade its light away
The good will go, the bad must stay

On the destination day
When all life is blown away
On the destination day
There is no more use in praying

Nuclear power will soon
Bring all mankind to fall
They destroy all their land just for cash
And they don't care at all
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Your body is covered with lava
Torn up from Earth's crust

The sea will overflow the land
And you will die then hand in hand

On the destination day
When all life is blown away
On the destination day
There is no more use in praying

Blood Drenched Execution
Carnage inspired by hatred and evil
Fatalities the final solution
Feel the fucking pain
I rip your child from your cunt
The fetus is kept alive
To die before caring eyes

Slaves in hell for me
A tortured death will set you free
The executioner
I was meant to be
Born to kill for all eternity

The exsanguination
Savage display of murder and mayhem
Casualities of primal abduction
Red is spraying from
The hole in the baby's head
The slaughter will not subside
This day a family dies

Young blood is so pure
Unborn infant is dead premature
The executioner
Has to mutilate
A fetal pulp is all that remains

Rapid blood loss
Flooding the floor
Gore is unstoppable
Rabid blood lord
Carving the whore
Extremely contemptible
Rancid rancor
Insatiable from my proclivity
Random tirade
Eternal death inevitable

Burn my toes

/the-carpenters/,Christmas Song,/the-carpenters/christmas-song.html,"All through the year

We've waited

Waited through spring and fall

To hear silver bells ringing

See winter time bringing

The happiest season of all



Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

Jackfrost nippin' at your nose

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

And folks dressed up like Eskimos



Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Will help to make the season bright

Tiny tots with their eyes of a glow

Will find it hard to sleep tonight



(*) They know that Santa's on his way

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

And every mother's child is going to spy

To see if reindeer really know how to fly



(**) And so I'm offering this simple phrase

To kids from one to ninety-two

Although it's been said many times,

Many ways

Merry Christmas to you



Repeat (*)

Straight on the ocean to an unholy land
Sirens were calling, only exist to believe
Longing for their souls, possessed by the misty morning

From far away
Praying for a wonder

Their thoughts were blinded, the tide's turning high
Searching for fool's gold under the blackened sky
The sea is deep and it wait's endlessly
Hungry for souls, for you and for me

Leaving tears in the sky

We send satellites to space
And we own the biggest missiles
We give millions of support for technology
But still we can't even live in peace with our neighbour
Most of us are insane of neuroses

Enough is enough - You can control
Enough is enough - Those who don't know

Faster - This world is heading straight into a big disaster
Tell me, when will it reach its end?
Bigger - When moneymakers stamp our souls with technology
Believe me, this got to reach an end
All this misery in our minds will break free, you will see...

Social psychology - Seek the key for our salvation
This science needs more support, it could help that
The understanding of the single person can grow
But who pays
'Cause if we stay weak we are much better to use

Enough is enough - Head over heart
Enough is enough - Right from the start

Faster - This world is heading straight into a big disaster
Tell me, when will it reach its end?
Bigger - When moneymakers stamp our souls with technology
Believe me, this got to reach an end
All this misery in our minds will break free, you will see...

Science is only as good or as bad
As the people who use it
And if we want to have a tomorrow
We should take ten percent of the money from our armies
And develop the minds of our nations

Enough is enough - You can control
Enough is enough - Those who don't know

Faster - This world is heading straight into a big disaster
Tell me, when will it reach its end?
Bigger - When moneymakers stamp our souls with technology
Believe me, this got to reach an end

Faster - A victory 'bout fear, this is the greatest glory
Believe me, the first step has been made
Bigger - The real progress - Another quality in our way of life
From quantity to quality
Away from misery in our minds, make them free, it's got to be...

Slicing the waves and the sea
Rotting below, they'll not let us go
Only mutiny or death set us free

Arms grow numb and the blood doth drip
To the beat of the drum, from the crack of the whip

And our lips we're cut to the gums
And you whipped us because: we could not row""

Endlessly toil by the hour
Bodies broken, shackled with hatred
As the soul grows sour

Off in the distance, the cry of the gulls
And the smell of approaching land
With our last ounce of strength, we pull to the shore
And dream to escape if we can

You like fetus', his cohort- the roscoes and cletus'
Riot like carman with the intent of harmin'
Attacks in every area, deadly like malaria
And viruses, i can see the hurt in your iris'
Why was this turmoil aimed at me?
A curse put in reverse, i suspect aptly
Much thought is required in the question you just
Blurted
Take the script called your life, make some changes
And reword it
Take callin' with the bawlin', time is nigh to put
Asunder, scatter blunder
Fresh manna feeds the hunger.

Chorus:
Why you livin' on the chance for hopes and dreams
When you should be takin' life the way that it seems
Nothin' good will manifest, your still intent on being
Blessed
Why you livin' on a chance for hopes and dreams?

Recollections and memoirs of a pre-saved era, although
I waddled in the truth i still dipped in the devil's
Terror
Bad is bad, you could say i had my share of it
Doing nothing drastic, depending on how you stare at
It
Skipping down the road i see the signs ahead and then
Cadaver central opens once the flesh is dead
'cause it's knowda not yoda don't toy when finding
Paths, then select the narrow 'cause the broad has
Booby traps
For me to fall in and all together miss my callin'
Snares placed strategically, realms changed
Metaphysically
Fools don't know and yet they really don't know, the
Failure to receive the wisdom stumps the inner mans
Growth
It's difficult to understand if you can't fathom the
Wrath i ask you-what if the rapture sweeps past?
In the end is only when you'll feel the strength of
The seven
Sorrow goes out for opposition-armagedon is the place
Where his kingdom will cross the lost and victory goes
Unto those who took the cross
So now i take my stand, subject myself to persecution
Since i've been informed i'm not alarmed by execution
In the public
Relationship with christ none above it, i love it
I'm mesmerized beyond infatuation
To show the love of christ tightens other relations
Waitin' in his midst to catch a glimpse of his glory.

Chorus

Yo change up that beat so they can peep my direction
To blood streams legal syringes of rhyme lectures
Infectious as wounds cleanse internal like prunes
Soon callin' his name some will still see doom
You assume, 'cause you mention him as lord of your
Life
On award shows and albums everything is alright
Who you? i never knew, say you did what for me?
But you can start now, depart now, worker of iniquity
Them shout outs, got you spat out quicker than cobras
Livin' beyond reproach until your sins found you broke
Breathless you choke and gasp
In his name you asked forgiveness of your past and
Aquital for your task
Ask me? you livin' on chances with lucky odds
Got one up, still breathin' frontin' with god
But the time has come don't miss the cue, be false or
True
'cause them ""freak me baby, thanks to my savior"" days
Are through
Straight up, i'm tired of fakes that be claimin' in
The family
Granted, our mother's one but our fathers are know
Foes
So those who claim relations hope your life is the
Proof
Ain't no playin' with you
Spoke in love but in truth
And intents of being blessed and nothin' good is
Manifesting from your life man-you livin' on a chance
Of hopes and dreams.",en

Strains the mind, night after night

Snake oils on the boil

So will I pop'em out the sky and never do another show
Or will I see another level like some elevator doors yea

Then we should move to action

Well ask a hungry man if prayer can fill his belly up
Before you crucify my view make sure you understand
I love to pray but also feel like I should lend a hand
And I've been guilty of forgettin all my fellow man

I need them in my hands
Question my motives
Why do I need
Another pair when I got thirty that won't see my feet
And it ain't wrong to want some nice things

At the end of the day
The end of the light
She remains of all of her foes
Miranda is dying with all of her might
She never comes
She always goes

She sticks the camera right into her arm
Anything to forget what the trouble's about
It causes her pain
That's part of the charm
She's down for the count
And finally out

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

She sees her face in another magazine
And the walls all close in
As the fancy takes flight
Can't stand to be loved
But she loves to be seen
She slips headlong into the night

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

And then all at once
The sun starts to rise
She sees her father holding her down
All the daylight is poison to her eyes
She slips down the shade
And lets herself drown

Miranda is taking the stars down
A little something to call her own
By the light there still goes Miranda
And Miranda is always alone

The lights shot down in the arena
All across the safety zone
Loneliness follows Miranda
And Miranda is always alone
Miranda is always alone

Hoping for shelter I'm hungry for food
My eyes see fire, a gift from the Gods

Nothing left to say

Ferociously I tear at you
Flowing blood
No mercy as you cry and beg
No remorse
And I'd like to read your thoughts
As you draw your last breath
To feel that truth with pain and fear

Erase all memories of your life
You will have never been

I'll blind you to your deity
Crush your faith and hope
For it is all you have

Searing flesh
Violate the ones you love

Of my love, eternaly true
It's Written, and filled with devotion
From deep in my heart
And with my teenage sonata
Comes a prayer that we'll never part

And as long as we love
It will stay
We'll hear it on our wedding day

My lips can only kiss you
They can explain how you make me feel
but my teenage sonata
will tell you
that my love is real

My love is real
My love is real",en

Ayo its poison, ecstacy, coke
You say its love, it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescripting us medicine which is poison
Doctors injecting our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison

[Verse 1]
Niggas up in my hood be getting shot giving poison
In hospitals, shots rittle the block
Little children and elderly women run for their lives
Drizzling rain come out the sky every time somebody dies,
Must be out my fucking mind, what is this, the hundreth time?
Sending flowers to funerals, reading rest in peace
You know the usual, death comes in threes
Life is short is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
Its funny how these black killer companies is making money off us
Fast food, cola sodas, skull and bone crosses

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Sisters up in my hood trying to do good given choices
When pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
Stop working hoping that they find a man that will support them
Up late night on they mothers cordless, thinking a perm or
Bleaching cream will make better when they gorgeous
White girls tanning, lypo suction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips thats life destruction
Lightskin women, bi-racial hateful toward themselves
Denying even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods but I overstand the mental poison
Thats even worser than drugs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is poison
Who want beef now, my heat shell annoyed them, plaow

[Talking]
Never to worry, all the wrong doers got it coming back to em
A thousand times over
Every dog has its day and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to em
Everybody reaps what they souls thats how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse but we'll get through it
Yall be strong

[Verse 4]
The China-men built the railroad
The Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed em
They call it it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday hellday
Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles connecting and we hitting the lad
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad
It's all poison, all of my words to enemies it is poison
Rappers only talk about ki's, its all poison
How could you call yourself emcees you ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is all poison
Who want beef now, my heat shell annoyed them, plaow

What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga

[Verse 5]
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey
Light skin with herpees
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C.
This is the problem cause he never tell em he got it
From letting fags suck him off Rikers Island in nine-three
Drives in Benz, hangs in all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rocking their shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
Whats your name, where you from, chain blinging
Thinking girls everywheres dumb, taking powder ruining their lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head he got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDs
I contemplate, believing in karma
Those on top could just break and wont be eating tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleeping on niggas dreams
They leave when they nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
Knowing dudes thats neglecting their seeds
Instead of taking care of em they spending money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies
Cause when them kids get grown its too late for you
Now you old and you getting shitted on
Its all scientific, mystic, you know the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush killer til George Bush kills me

An interactive nightmare show which never ends
It just goes on and on and on and on

(Chorus)

And now, turn left
I have control
You are not required to think at all

Everything we hear (Goes on and on)
Everything we see
Everything we love (Goes on and on)
Everything we feel
Everything we want (Goes on and on)
Everything we do (And on)
Everywhere we go (And on)
Everything we know (And on)

I'm Feeling Cold Today
Frozen To The Core
I Need Some Inspiration To Pull Me From The Floor


Take Me Down The Road
To A Place I've Never Been Before
Open Up My Eyes
Show Me Colours That I've Never Seen
Open Up Your Mouth Give Me Perfect Words I've Never Heard

The Look In Every Strangers Face
Tells Me I'm Alone

They say our summer vacation
Has come to an end
And that we simply have no more holiday to spend

They say no more barefoot
No playing around in the pool
They say now it’s time for us to go back to school

Got all my friends, a teacher, okay
But why do we really have to study all day
Well see I’m on to your scam and I’ll tell you how
We ended up with a Fall that we know of now

A time was invented to keep the kids in the hall
They gave it a name and we all know it as Fall
The line of the story that I have presented
Fall is just something that grown-ups invented.

Though some things in Fall are just too good to pass
Jumping in leaves and Halloween is a gas
But I’d rather see to it that the truth be told
So I better do it now before I grow old

They wanted a break after the summer disarray
To rest up then handle the stress of Christmas day
So the grown-ups got together and made up the rule
That kids shouldn’t be playing
No they should be in school

A time was invented to keep the kids in the hall
They gave it a name and we all know it as Fall
The line of the story that I have presented
Fall is just something that grown-ups invented.

The pain compressed
Inside of my chest
My heart stops beating with each breath
I take made a couple mistakes
but fuck it, it breaks me to hear you have nothing to say
I'm always stuck in the same situation yo
And there ain't nothing you can say to take my soul
So make me go
I don't wanna breath no more
I don't wanna see you cheat so just leave me alone

Feel like I'm dyeing inside
Trying to hide my feelings came alive as she cried
Tired of lies
The pain has awaken my thoughts
Taken these shots of pills got me shaken a lot
From the reactions can't control the tears
And the only thing that I have all my hopes and fears
Mostly fears so how am I supposed to die
I tried everything and failed on my only try

Take me away from the things that she said I don't want you to be alone (always on my own!)
take me away from the things that she said I want you so leave me alone (alone!)

Take; take me away from the pain cause
Inside of my brain I can never escape the chosen
My hearts cold inside of my chest broken
And I can never erase the words that she spoke when
If was fine tryin' to gather some sense
Tryin' to change plans so it wouldn't happen again
But it was too late
My faith had beaten me to it
It's ruined all of the chances were damned or polluted
And all that I can do is wish for love
It's rough when the one you love doesn't give a fuck
I try hard but always end up givin up can't live for much when my wrists are cut
drips of blood Eyes shut closed for days
Still memories remain when I touch your face
Cant brush the pain so I just move on
But the feelings will always row in these fuckin' songs!

to find some love in the madness

I am just another man, sorry for the pain that I've caused
I know that you'll understand, these demons'll drive me - insane
I've been goin mad, rightly oughta blow out my brains
Cuz I'm hurtin bad but I'm fightin... blast, on the other day
These problems got me usin more drugs, along with the other things
I'm slowly fading into my thoughts, (come against me, bring it on!)
and I'm driftin in and outta space, and I don't believe I'm wakin up
with the alcohol, them drinks, drift me to another world
Where the sunshine stay shinin, I think I was finna url

Tomorrow, I'll be somebody else, cuz I ain't been me
I can't seem to shake these, I'll put that there on every day
Boy tryna figure me out, is like Lamar changing
But my childhood was fucked up - raised rowdy by a single moms
She told me my daddy didn't give a fuck, she ain't let him do his job
Seventh grade; failing, and I don't know my next of kin
These days in these fucked up ways, who the fuck are them?
My daddy had three other kids, but I ain't never seen 'em
So, ain't no sense in coming around now, you ain't been here befo'
It's sad but I ain't feelin nuttin, my whole life's been a fuckin maze
and when I tried to locate my siblings, they were gone away
Lost inside they other things, fucked me then, fucked me now
Quick to tell me ""Show you some love"" nigga show you Hell
Ain't no love I'm feelin here, I ain't never felt this vile
Momma - did you really love me, or was I just a child?
Said it, outside, I knew you seen it in my face
I wasn't really happy here, but I was forced to lead the way
Copped me a Cheverolet, drift away to the other side just to think
If I get to see Heaven, I can thank you for the ride
and thank you for my other kids and even though
they mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad,
low on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be
the bad guy that I really ain't, bitch so quick to hassle me
Cuz I don't see my kids enough, but I make the time to pick 'em up
But you find somethin to stick in my face - it ain't me fuckin up
It's bad enough, face to face, always wanna catch a case
So bad, they'll try an get me they make me - and what takes the cake
Is the whole world is fuckin up, daddy know where the weankess at
and you spoke lies to ya old mans eyes, how could you sleep wit that?
Jepordize everything, just for searchin for larger life
Sacrificin the whole family, with no regards to Christ
Funny how people can take this shit for granted, right?

/chris-de-burgh/,She Must Have Known,/chris-de-burgh/she-must-have-known.html,"From Timing Is Everything
written by Chris de Burgh and Mark Spiro, lyrics by Chris de Burgh

Year Released: 2002

Playing Time: 3:29



She must have known from the moment she saw him,
From the look in his eye, and the way that he smiled,
She must have dreamed of lying beside him,
His hands on her body, his whispers of love;

There is nothing that the eye can't see,
There is nothing that the heart can't feel,
There is nothing that a love can't heal, whatever is waiting,
It is meant to be, it is meant to be;

She must have felt the stirrings of passion,
It's been missing so long with the man in her life,
But now at last there is someone beside her,
Somebody to guide her, someone to love;

There is nothing that the eye can't see,
There is nothing that the heart can't feel,
There is nothing that a love can't heal, whatever is waiting,
It is meant to be;

Oh the time will come when we'll be living the dream,
It's that miracle moment for being what we believe;

There is nothing that the eye can't see,
There is nothing that the heart can't feel,
There is nothing that a love can't heal, whatever is waiting,
Sooner or later, it is meant to be, it is meant to be, it was meant to be,
She must have known - it was meant to be,
She must have known - it was meant to be,
She must have known - it was meant to be,
She must have known;

Now she's heading for the sunshine,
She's gonna be like Shirley Valentine,
She must have known - it was meant to be,
She must have known - it was meant to be;
She must have known ,
Now she's heading for the sunshine,
She's gonna be like Shirley Valentine
She must have known.

Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl?
Is that the reason I'm to blame?
Before I do it, is it because he treated you badly?
I always stand accused? Mmmm

Protecting yourself from somebody else? I'm not who's hurting you!

Girl and it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him!
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, I can't win NO!
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl but I refuse to pay for something I didn't do?
I love you girl!
But I refuse to stay paying for his mistakes.

Yeah Oh Yeah Yeah

He left a scar across your heart
I understand girl
Don't let his wrongs,
tear us apart,No
Girl I'm your man!
Just because he did you swear I'm cheating ?
You think I just don't care?
What must I do die For another man's crime?
Girl you know that ain't fair No No

And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him!
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win,No I can't win!

Baby girl but I refuse to pay for something I didn't do?
I love you girl!
But I refuse to stay...
Paying for his mistakes.

I know he did you wrong
But tell me what does that have to do with me?
Trying to show you something real!
Figure out what is going on

A loser to your game.
The people that you hung around
Have led you all astray.

So don't be superstitious

There's a brand new situation
You're the one that's here to stay.

To get you through the line.
But now you're stuck in overdrive
And all you need is time.

Nothing can come quick enough.

Hold on and be tough.

She was living here

And losing one you love is like a storm

Silencing the voice of mortal tragedy
Listening to whispers of the soul

And now I ain't got no worries
Ain't got no one to call my own
I said but when I got just a little bit older
All I got had come undone
Let's go boys

Fallin' Apart At The Seams
Ah yea
Old man looks much younger now
He lost his strength respect somehow
Look in the mirror at what I found
It's just the past and it's over now
Ooo it's over now
Ooo it's over now

My heart's like a wheel
And my head's just a stone
I got my memories
Ain't got no home

I'm fallin'
Ooo fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'
Ooo yea fallin' apart at the seams

Old friends seem much closer now
They stand the test of time somehow
Look at the winner who hit the ground
It comes around and then it goes back down

Ooo it's over now
Ooo it's over now
My heart's like a wheel
And my head's just a stone
I got no memories
Ain't got no home

I'm fallin'
Ooo fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'
Ooo yea fallin' apart at the seams

My heart's like a wheel
And my head's just a stone
I got my memories
Ain't got no home

I'm fallin'
Ooo fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'
Ooo yea fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'

Fallin' apart at the seams
Fallin'

Sendin' Jesus subpoenas

So Sister Act
Cause black nun (none) get love
And I'm a have juice till Mark Ferman plants the bloody glove

Ras Kass:
But there ain't no angel that you can strangle Los Angels

Xzibit:
See handguns and girls that's the way of the underworld

Ras Kass:
There ain't no angel that you can strangle Arch Angels (say what?)

Ras Kass:
See left coast niggas is the Craziest
I dodge shotgun pellets in the felonious Los Skandalous
Golden State
Home of dysfunctional gang truces
5.8 quakes where glass houses pancake (westsiiiiiide)
But I be in the hood like a rebuilt engine
Fuck what I'm benchin' I weave through tracks like extensions (nigga)
I'm ridin' for chips like on time on motorcycles
And for looters to get trifle
I'm like a chink on a Slason swap meet roof with two automatic rifles
Puberty got me Vicious
And these generation X bitches is too big for they britches
15 goin' on 30
""I wanna fuck"" written all over their faces with mack compact blowin' kisses
Promoted like seven oasis gettin' niggas twisted in statutory rape cases
But I write rhymes in enough white lines askin' Melle Mel my punchlines
Hit from the baseline like six by nines
Crack addicts and Reggie Miller
That's fo reala
I X more Hollywood Squares than Phillis Dilla

Ras Kass:
You know man all I have in this world is two things man
That's my word and my balls
Or maybe that's three things
So on microphones I let my nuts hang like John Homes
And took so many niggas out I should change my name to Chaperone
D-Mac and Laylaw know that on mic cables
I got one thousand two hundred techniques similar to the turntable
So if it's crem de la creme since I'm smarter I oughta
Float like dead bodies in water
Manana tell your girl this here mayatti got one extra backstage pass
If she put 'em on the glass
Cause she be jockin' rappers that be seen with who's who
The single charters so she blows me for a hit like cluckheads do
No MC parallels they behind bars like Rick's jail cell
To rock well I need a beat like...
Child abuse victims (ha ha)
Everything I say turn to yay
This shit was blowin' kids away before Timothy McVeigh

Where icicles hung the blossoms swing,
but in my heart there is no spring.
You were my spring, my summer too,
it's always winter without you.

The flocks head north and the lilacs bloom,
at night they scent my moonlit room.
You were my spring, my summer too,
I'm going north to look for you.

Like a windblown bird my heart goes forth,
sent by the spring to the shining north.
You are my spring, my summer too,
and I won't rest till I find you.

What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face

Screaming, screaming for vengeance

Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter

As the sweat is running down your neck
All your praying for's to stop you body breakin' up
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load

Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line

Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake

What's this I hear about these perfect 10s
My colleagues squawk about
Them Ritzy girl friends
A hundred pounds, a hundred pounds of trash
They talk to me, they ramble on in my ears
And their conversation's boring
I would bet anyone 50 dollars
'Cause I only wagon on the surest things
Anywhere, anywhere she would go
I would follow 500 miles away from home
Just for a fling, for a fling

26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26

I haven't known too many women
Throughout my less than lustrous career
But of all the relationships I've been in
To my 26 the others can't compare
She's my best bosom buddy, she's my partner
In the things I find important to share
She is fine, incredibly fine, it's no wonder
That she catches, that she catches all the stares

26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26
26, my baby's a 26
On a scale of 1 to 10, my baby's a 26

26, my baby's a 26

Draw a kid, left behind
Severed limbs in harmony
Strumming from a few good deeds

Carry it to survive
To a bed half alive
Held before a dozen times
Deep inside a funeral for a friend:

Runs in portions like film clips
Run, run
Rundown the list
The memoirist
Like kindling
Burn, burn, burn, and burn down

I will stay inside
The saved
It's a good mourning
They will ignite you (soon)
The doomed
I will write for you

Of a boy, damaged goods
Of a bench, understood
For a spell, the soul resides
In a yellow chalk outline

Carry on the camel's back
Have another heart attack
To the cure I would drive
Played that scene a hundred times to date

Today's ambition, to relate
In a sustaining saccharine state
Impart the burden and get well
It's what everyone's trying to sell

Anything you want it to be
Weigh the screenplay and revise
Warp, warp, warp with the contortionist
So hopelessly ill-fated everyday

He will stay inside
The doomed

They will inspire him

First of all, the term ""black and white"" is a fallacy. It simply is another
way of saying ""this or that"". Let's examine the term ""this or that"" in its
ultimate form which is: ""this"" means the truth or ""that which is resistant 2
it. When a minority realizes its similarities on a higher level- not just
""black""- but PEOPLE OF COLOR, and higher still ""INDIGENOUS"", and even higher
still, ""FROM THE TRIBE OF."", and yet higher- the ""RAINBOW CHILDREN"". When
this understanding comes, the so-called minority becomes a majority in the
wink of an eye. This action will cause a Reaction or Resistance. The source
of this Resistance must b banished as it is in direct conflict with the
initial action. It cannot be assimilated, 4 its very nature is resistance.
In other words, ONE CANNOT SERVE 2 MASTERS. U r either ""this"" or ""that""

The sparks of the tempest rage a hundred years on
The voice of the dreamer screams, the cause of the pawn
The King and the Queen are gone, each piece is the same
The difference between us is a part of the game

Darkness is spreading like a spot on the sun
The dead are the living in the age of the gun
While everyone clamors for the justice they seek
The world is corrupted and the strong take the weak

They mold you and shape you, they watch what you do
The sparks of the tempest are burnin' you through
Spreading like wildfire, fallin' like rain
Though they may promise, they only bring pain

The future is managed, and your freedom's a joke
You don't know the difference as you put on the yoke
The less that you know the more you fall into place
A cog in the wheel, there is no soul in your face

Run for the cover, Millennium's here
Bearing the standard of confusion and fear
Spreading like wildfire, fallin' like rain
Though they may promise, they only bring pain

Blood in the sand, a cry in the street
Now the cycle is nearly complete
Ten thousand years, and nothing was learned
No turning back, now the wheel has turned

Big Brother is watching and he likes what he sees
A world for the taking, when he's ready to squeeze
The King and the Queen are gone, each piece is the same
The difference between us is a part of the game

Faded off gin, last call for alcohol
I brought it all out I'm gon' spend
My homies got all of 'em in
And niggas be mad at us cuz
They ain't ballin' they money ain't tall as us
But I never worry 'bout niggas
Who talk that shit but they can't follow us

Now look how I rep that shit I was raised on
And them dollar signs what it's based on
And I roll around and I do me
Spent a long time in that hooptie
But I get it in, smoke a lot of trees, drink a lot of gin
Nigga like me got a couple friends
And a couple bottles and a couple bands
But I'm all in
Came in the game, balling

My old school with it's?
And I'm cashin only, y'all stolen
End of the night, yo' bitch I'm callin'
But fuck it nigga, wanna roll with me
Let her fire it up, let her smoke with me
She don't fuck with lames but she love a g
And she love the way I slang the d (dang)

But I'm in the club and don't fuck with haters
Don't need them niggas tryna bother me
But I'm poppin' bottles for the time to be
Standin' on the couch, call it luxury
Little model chicks wanna fuck with me
Wanna smoke with me, wanna drink with me
Wanna come with me
But I'm in and out like I'm supposed to be
Still smokin' trees",en

Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven

For the crime of having no dough
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go

If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind

And as soon as you discover where you're goin'
Can I walk along the way , along the way
I'm lonesome and I need somebody knowin'
Just a few nice words to get me through the day

If your mind is in the darkness , could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow
And will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world just a frame of mind

If you're living in Chicago, you're alone

My condolences to anyone who has ever lost me
And, to anyone who got lost in me
Or, to anyone who ever felt they took a loss with me
My apologies for the misunderstanding or the lack thereof
I'm sorry you missed the God in me
And I'm sorry you missed the light
I'm sorry you forgot the way I arose like the moon
Night after night with the burden to forgive
Eager to feed you everything
See, I'm a holy woman
I know what it's like to give life to a being
without ever needing to press skin against one another
I've practiced how to hold my tongue long enough
I'm afraid I forgot to say goodbye
I'm afraid you're under the impression
That I was made to please you
I was under the impression you understood me better
The truth is, I'm a superwoman
And some days I'm an angry woman
And some days I'm a crazy woman
For still waiting, for still loving harder even if I'm aching
For still trusting that I'm still worth the most
For still searching for someone to understand me better",en

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
Black dog
Drinks from the water
Trying to cool his tongue
Like the king
Finds no peace
His work is never done
Night falls
Smoke on the water
Darkness closes in
Cold white hand, in the deep
Will drown you for your sin

[Chorus 2: Zac Brown]
It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
They just keep on fitting

[Bridge: Zac Brown]
Crying out
Go and wake the king
Call to arms
For those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground
The walls are coming down
It's do or die
Do or die

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Mad man
Blood on the alter
The Queen will have his head
His ghost will shake those rattling chains
Long after he's dead
No soul, knows he is trouble
High upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many
He bares that weight alone

When the smoke's 2 thick 2 blow

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the 'dro

Flows tighter, hot headed as ghost rider
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin' a spider in the snow

Inside of a low rider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the hoes?

Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't gob this is a blister in the salt
Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost
Shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze, beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws

And cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all

That you could stand a fuckin' chance is assanine
Yeah, ask the nine man, hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon

Fuck it I ain't playin', pull up in a van and hop out
At a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'

Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand

Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you got me, got me? And you can't live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a fuck about me
Ain't about ""Dog I wanna be just like you""
How about you wanting to be just like you?
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride big every fuckin' day (I-ight?)
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine
Let me hit 'em with the rewind
Do you and I'll do me
To me you'll see how real you'll be

Do you - Cuz you are held accountable for you
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - Cuz I'mma do me, truley

Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (Word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the Lord, we see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
Now the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Hey yo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go for what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog
Look through your eyes, see what you see

[Repeat 1]

Like fuck it, you wanna be me? Here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch Turn into a killer,
don't carry shottie
Cuz the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you

I met up with The Gambler; We were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' through the window at the darkness.
Til' boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak.

He said: ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
""And knowin' what their cards were, by the way they held their eyes.
""And if you don't mind my sayin', I would say you're out of aces;
""And for one taste of your whiskey, I will give you some advice.""

So I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette; then he bummed a light.
The night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression.
He said: ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right.""

""'Cos ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survival,
""Is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.
""And ev'ry hand's a winner, just like ev'ry hand's a loser.
""And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.

""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.
""You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
""There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.""

""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.
""You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
""There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.""

And when he finished speakin', he turned back t'ward the window.
Put out his cigarette; faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.


""You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
""Know when to walk away; know when to run.
""You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.

That old life-style will be the death of me

Your eyes reflect like mirrors
The beauty in your soul
But anger shatters precious glass

Can't you recall the intimate
Secrets that we truly shared
The faith and trust we swore would always last

I only have myself to blame
You know it takes my breath away
To see you cry

To love I implore, I scream in the air
Claw at my chest, rip out my hair
Embrace me or let my spririt die

Rescue me or bury me
Rescue me or bury me

Time is like a prison cell
For those whose crime is loneliness
When freedom's banging at their door

When all has been said and done
You must decide swallow your pride and
Reach out and take these hands forevermore

What would Willie do, well he\'d travel so far with nothing but a song and his old guitar
And a tour bus and some semi-trucks, thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
Well he loves all the people, the ugly and the randy
If you don\'t believe me take a look at the family
And they\'ll tell you that it\'s true
When skies are gray what would Willie do

Well long ago he came unto us, his words were simple but they went right through us
And the whole world sang along, but then they didn\'t want to hear his songs
He was gone and we thought we\'d lost him
But he grew his hair and he moved to Austin
And all of the people smiled, they came to hear him sing from miles
Like a miracle all those rednecks and hippies
From New York City down to Mississippi
Stood together and raised a brew
When it\'s all gone wrong what would Willie do

You know sometimes I wonder when I ain\'t gettin\' nowhere
What would old Willie do when it all gets too much to bear
And I can see him on his lonely old tour bus
And he\'s got his problems just like any of us
Well he\'d just take a deep breath and then he\'d let it all go
And he\'d take another deep breath and let it all go
And he\'d take another deep breath...and he\'d hold it
Ah and I bet he\'d feel hungry in a way that seems strange
Yeah hungry for all the things that he just can\'t change
Like the time he passed out in is own bedroom
And his wife sewed him up in the sheets and beat him with a broom and he forgave her
And you think that\'s rough, well then the IRS came and they took away all of his stuff
They took his golf course and his recording studio, and he just went out and did another show
So when it\'s all coming down on you
You better ask yourself what would Willie do

What would Willie do, well he\'d take a little time
And talk to old rooser as he\'d drive on down the line
And there\'s millions down that road, and with a word he\'s gonna lighten their load
He loves all the people no matter their races
Hell he even had a hit country song with Julio Iglesias
And that ain\'t easy to do, so when it\'s all too much, what would Willie
When the game gets tough what would Willie
When they call your bluff what would Willie do",en

And come along with me

And upon it grows fine grain
Surely 'tis a place of residence
For a soldier to remain
Where the sugar cane is plentiful
And the tea grows on the tree

And now he's gone far away from me

Back against the wall, what do you hold onto?
I know it's something that we all go through
Just aim for yours
When it rains, it pours
I'll learn how to fly again

I was born a prince
The supreme council had advised against this
But I was in love, and I followed my heart

No getting used to living a human life (Uh-uh)
May sound stupid, I'm not human, but I'm human-like (Right)
My skin glow in the dark, it's only safe for me to move at night
Sometimes my eyes turn black while in the pale moonlight (I got you)
I'm your guardian angel (Who?) , and it translates into Kevin (Kevin)
No love like mine, another lifetime, we used to be together (We used to be together)
It hurt my heart to see you hurt, in desperate need of affection
Gave up my wings and fell in love, was 'posed to be your protector
Love somebody else, you broke my heart and it's just not getting better
The angels telling me that God won't let me back into Heaven
Bae, I'm tired of playing games with you
I know inside, you feel the same way I do
We the reciprocal of one another, come from the same star
We got the same O's under our nose and we got the same scars
La Fitness, wasn't surprised at all, we driving the same car
Same mall, shopping on impulse, I don't find it odd
Breadwinner, moving them kilos 'round, I'ma supply the raw
Great pretenders, we on the Instagram actin' like we not involved

Back against the wall, what do you hold onto?
I know it's something that we all go through
Just aim for yours
When it rains, it pours
I'll learn how to fly again
I'll learn how to fly again
I'll learn how to fly again
I'll learn how to fly again
I'll learn how to fly again

Your majesty
The royal court's decision is respected and it's entirely part of Breadwinner world court and executive style
But we both know our exercise of passionate speech by fluctuation of tone and pitch
May have aroused unwanted recollections of negative occurrences
But no harm would've ever come to one possessing royal blood from dying on hand
For as we move in the signs of love, true peace, freedom, and justice
Only he that draws his sword shall be met with brute force
If you would've decreed that matter saying we were cleared for departure
I would've threw it all away and accepted whatever ridicule or consequence behind my actions
For I believe in our love
And one day maybe in this eternity or another
You'll see yourself for what I know you to be
A queen
If you ever need me for anything, this line never changes
Such is my love for you
For you are me, and I am you
I'm in love with you
The short moments we shared will forever be appreciated
I never withheld anything from you because my heart rests securely with you
I know you'd never do me a bitch ass thing
My heart will forever hurt to be in your arms
But at least we both know I'm willing to die for my beliefs
'Cause I've died for you before
And regret it not
For I did it all for the glory of love
In closing
I remain the same, I come as I leave
Upright, independent, and fearless
We just both good at pretending
I love you forever

And you don't have a dime
And you can't even call her on the phone

So you distract yourself, but it just doesn't do any good

Cause they'll never change they don't wanna know
About the ""sin"" in you, and the wasting of time
They wanna grab your hair and pull you in line

The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, of a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all colors of the wind.

You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy, living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of your own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You use to tell me, we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get an old feeling, when you walk
through that door.
Cause tonight, is the night
When I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman, is gonna love you more
Cause tonight is the night, that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through

Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down
It ain't very much but she brings home the bacon and the bread

We got a mortgage we pay just a little bit on
But it seems like all of our money is gone
Before we get a chance to get ahead
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff

Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age
Small stuff
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff
So we don't sweat the small stuff

There's a little bitty hole in the ceiling above
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night
Had to drive it home with one taillight
When I went out this morning, the engine was dead
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff

Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age

Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust

Wells dried out
Desert
Taps turned off
My mind's cloudy with heat
The weather blues

Lights gone out
Dammit
Paid my dues
At least stars are out
A glob of fat on spoon
A fat full moon

Came across this ghost town to the west
Every house was looted, left for dead
Crow, Coyote circling (what's left)
No snow capped mountains, wells as dry as tombs

Farmers drilled down past the riverbed
Pulled up rare and ancient species
Trees are gnarled to ghostly shapes
Limbs beetle dead make monstrous silhouettes

We're all walking south
Unforgiving
Now the fire's gone out
Never waste a breath
We're all moving south
Regrets

Pray this weather cycles
Pray and dance for rain
Faith in moving mountains
Faith died on the plains
Land is parched and burning
Jump the fire lanes

Too late we're all responsible
Too late to hold a wake
We're all drilled out

Who is ur real father?
The everlasting one
The one who came from nothing
And yet from this one, everything comes

The one who commands ur momma
With the simple phrase ""I am""
And every time that she obeys
She gives birth 2 the Son of Man
Who is this?

Reproduction of the new breed leader/Stand up and organize!
Reproduction of the new breed leader/Stand up and organize!

The Agreement-
With every birth, we keep it so/Never changing one piece of it
In fear of what would unfold/The scales would then become unbalanced
And thus would begin the fall/The sin of one would become
The sin of one and all

Rise, rise, rise.
Rise, Rainbow Children, rise
Rise, Rainbow Children, rise

The Wise One who understood the law that was handed down from God long ago,
held fast in his belief that the Lord would bring him another one who loved him so.

It seemed to have no end

And now you say you don't know
Where your future lies
But you've got to find it now
Or get left behind

Take some time to speak your mind
But say it's not over
Please don't turn me away

You just have to tell me


Remember those fireside nights
It's not that long ago
You said you wanted to stay there forever
I have you the strength of my hand
When things were running low
I didn't know you would go back on
What you said
There must be some reasons there
That you don't want to share

She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve

My presence felt like an intrusion
Causing way too much confusion

I've been banished and cast out

Though I'm acting nonchalant it's clear

The manipulation, encroachment and destruction of their inferiors

Growing up in public, growing up in public with your pants down

Some people are into sadistic pleasures
They whet their desires and drool in your ears
They're quasi-effeminate characters in love with oral gratification
They edify your integrities, so they can play on your fears

They're gonna do you in public, 'cause you're growing up in public
They're gonna do it to you in public,
'Cause you're growing up in public with your pants down

Some people think that the whole concept's a joke
But some people think being a man is the whole point
And then some people wish they'd never awoke

Up from a dream of nightmarish proportions
Down to a size neither regal nor calm
A Prince Hamlet caught the middle between reason and instinct
Caught in the middle with your pants down again

Caught in the middle, I'm really caught in the middle
I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle deciding about you

Just to hold a little hand...

The future is in these little hands and what they decide to do
But it's so hard to make the long long journey
Without big hands to help pull them through

Just to hold a little hand...
Oh what a feeling to hold a little hand",en

Lyrics by Tom Robinson
Available on the album 21 At 33

You've a certain sartorial eloquence
And a style that's almost of your own
You've got the knack of being so laid-back
It's like talking to the great Unknown
You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hairdo
Pretty certain that you've got it made
Oh your life-style shows in the clothes you chose
Sitting pretty in the masquerade

Sing it
Don't you wanna play this game no more
Don't you wanna play no more
Don't you wanna play this game no more
Don't you wanna play no more


You remain the only main contender
Though you never, you never meant to lose at all
Down at the mouth yet unsurrounded
Adamant before the fall
Though when you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed


Don't you wanna play this game no more
When you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed

Trip me once shame on you trip me twice I’m the fool
Thought it’s hidden I’ve been cured

Patience is divine but the virtue is not mine
Turn you cheek gets ripped off
That’s why god gave us four

This is how you spend life amused by another’s strife
Makes me so sad and confused
Someone’s pain you leisure
Can’t explain sick pleasure I’m so glad I’m not you

Throwing wrenches gave a false sense of power
What started sweet will soon turn sour
You think it’s your place to dispense justice
Well I’ve been sent to judge the judges

God damn love cause it’s breaking my heart
And if I had one wish, I’d see in the dark

Tripping a blind man so easy to do
Tripping a blind man why can’t it be you

You want to play god and I know you will
If that’s the case I’ll be the devil

Now who the fuck are you to discipline me
Innocence condemned by the guilty

God damn love cause it’s breaking my heart
And if I had one wish, I’d see in the dark

Panicking, the startled pet ran to the street
Sanitation truck skidding unable to stop
Shoveled up what was left of his canine spot

As they left, the ground turned muddy crimson

Ems responded “he had to say bye”

Now I can't pledge allegiance to your flag
Cause I can't find no reconciliation with your past
When there was nothing equal for my people in your math
You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads
The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs
I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad
The system is a slab
Corruption is the swinger sittin' high ridin' dirty,
drag racin' into danger
And it's so clean, pine trees smellin' good
With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood
So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours

And as it all falls down and tatters on the floor
I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore

I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass
A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag
Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have
As long as they look good when they be doin' bad
Then the separation from the truth is gettin' vast, fast
Be a slave at first or free at last
Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass
Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff
The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half
Divided over money
Delighted by the dummyin'
down of the importance of crowns we'll never have
That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath

Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft
Of the witches in this business that be livin' off your sad
Hatin' on your happiness you hit 'em off with laughs
Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad

When love would cast its spell
I'd recognize each curve and line of you

Now at last you're here and I can tell

Is all I've ever wanted

Is calling out my name
Your eyes it seems
Are mirrors of my dreams
In ways I can't explain
And my heart will never be the same



We never said a word
As if we'd always known
That through the bittersweet of waiting
We were not alone
Now we're close enough
For the touch of love to find us
Fantasies designed us
But they never really could
Begin to measure you
No pictures ever do
And as I watch you framed in sunlight
And a sky of blue
I know what my life's been leading to

Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Available on the album Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy

Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
""Two teas both with sugar please""
In the back of an alley

While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and ""Hey mom, do the papers say anything good.
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods""


Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback
The honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning


For cheap easy meals and hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town


And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

Look another way
You won't find it here
So die another day

The coldness of his words
The message in his silence,
""Face the candle through the wind...""
This distance in my voice
Isn't leaving you a choice
So if you're looking for a time to run away...

You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day

They took pictures of your dreams
Ran to hide behind the stairs
And said maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall
But if they don't come down
Resist the need to pull them in
And throw them away
Better to save the mystery
Than surrender to the secret

Now we had a dealer knock off joints, Julie's jackin
with the drop-off point (yo what the deal nigga)
You backed out, I fuckin WITNESSED it
And have partners have to split shit with
(Nah, pay me now, bust it)
At sundown see I went on work
I sent a tec mount in a tennis skirt, pop the blood claat
Watch a thug rock, slugs pop
With every cop on the block, with double-eye on my mugshots

Water into wine
Some say it's the devil's blood
They're squeezing from the vine
Some say it's a saviour
In these hard and desperate times
For me it helps me to forget
That we're just born to die

I came here like so many did
To find the better life
To find my piece of easy street
To finally be alive
And I know nothing good comes easy
All good things take some time
I made my bed I lie in it
To die in it's the crime

You can't help but prosper
When the street are paved with gold
They say the oil wells ran deeper here
Than anybody's known
I packed up on my wife and kid
And left them back at home
Now there's nothing in this paydirt
The ghost are all I know

Now the oil's gone
The money's gone
And the jobs are gone
Still we're hangin' on

Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash the sins from off our hands
Here in dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here alive

In the blessed name of Jesus
I heard a preacher say
That we are God's children
And that he'd be back someday
And I hoped that he knew
Something as he drank his cup of wine
I didn't have too good of a feeling
As I head out to the night

I cursed the sky to open
I begged the clouds for rain
I prayed to God for water
For this burning in my veins
It was like my soul's on fire
And I had to watch the flames
All my dreams went up in ashes
And my future blew away

Now the oil's gone
The money's gone
And the jobs are gone
Still we're hangin' on

Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash the sins from off our hands
Here in dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here alive

Men spend their whole lives
Waiting praying for their big reward
But it seems sometimes
The payoff leaves you feeling
Like a dirty whore
If I could choose the way I'll die
Make it by the gun or knife
'Couse the other way there's too much pain
night after night after night...

The tree that wasn't meant to be
Though I.. struggle in my life, I never give up
And you.. know that I, will always be by your side
My family tree.. yeah a family tree
Yeah, my family tree.. my fam-i-ly tree

I find, greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
It blossoms in.. darkness, and gives birth to a promising pod
You'll never see me give up

I will press on.. never hold my head alone
Never no.. my family tree.. my family tree yeahhh
My family treeeee.. family treeeee..

[speaking]
Because we all spring from different trees
does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
or in the vast forest in which it breathes?

The tree must fight to breathe
among the evils of the weeds

I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving - family - tree",en

I don't care if her nose is long
I don't care if shes underfeed
I don't care if her clothes are wrong
First I look at the purse.

they want the waist line to be small.
I don't care if their legs all vein
I don't care if their teeth are big
I don't care if she wears a ring
Why waste time looking at the waist line
Cause first I look at the purse....Yeah!

A woman can be as fine as can be
Kisses sweeter than honey
That don't mean a thing to me,
if you ain't got no money, baby.
Cause if the purse is fat, thats where it's at. yeahaa...

Some fellows like the way they walk,
the way they swing and sway.
Some fellows like the way they talk,

I don't care if she waddles like a duck or talks with a lisp
I still think I'm in good luck if the dollar bills are crisp

it's back again
but don't be angry
that your heart could be so wrong

singing the same old song

And the maid that was there all day

And she was quite good at kissing
She lived on her own in a rundown one bed flat
Her dad left to fight, not for her

The ones that taught us right from wrong

Lyrics by Gary Osborne
Available on the album A Single Man

Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours

So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks


He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more


Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper


And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours


Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper",en

No illusions at the turning of the century.
All our wishes - forever free -
all destroyed because somehow we lost the masterkey.

Leaving my dreams far behind,
got no ambitions in time if only I'm so

Black in mind, When there's no point in making it.
Black in mind. When there's no hope for love, I'm so
Black in mind. When these madmen are wasting it.
Black in mind. I don't want to be sacrificed for

a territorial war. Leave me alone, I'm so black in mind.

You made me want it, too blind to see
that all it gave me were illusions of reality.
My eyes got used to the things they've seen,

Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

(music: T. Koivusaari & E. Holopainen)

Terror, when the darkness binds your limbs
Terror, when the fear freezes your nerves
Horror, when the pain climbs up your veins
Darkness, creeping under you skin

Moment of life,
when we all have to choose,
which way to go
and for whom to sacrifice your life

Invoke the god - pray
To lead you back to life - pray
Cursed by religion - hate
Learned upon church - fake

In the verge of hell,
of human mind
Redemption of your soul,
as darkness binds you tight

when we all have to choose,
which way to go
and for whom to sacrifice your life

Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggaz like, ""yo fuck that bitch! ""

Aiyyo it's like this man, shorty got a kid
On some drunk after the club shit, we done did
All week bitches got me hittin the remy, full throttle
By the time I finish the bottle them bitches is models
Let me break it down like this, here's what happened
I was y'know, tryin to fuck and, once I get to rappin

We at the crib, bitches leave they panties on the doorknob
Puff somethin, ten minutes later we on the floor hard
Ah! Ah! Huffin and puffin
She screamed it more cause she can't get enough of the lovin
Now, look where it got us, nine months later
Baby is born and I'm realizin I hate her

""You don't gotta chill with her! "" man, they don't know
I'm still with her cause I'm tryin to see the baby grow
That's just the pops in me, see I ain't never had one
And now that I am a father I don't wanna be a bad one
As shorty get older, how do I explain
That I really can't stand his mother? She a pain!
And I never really liked the bitch, out the gate

It was those two bottles of remy, plus it was gettin late
Now I ain't say I ain't had nothin to do or to blame
Man I'm the dog, bitches stay screamin my name
She knew it was a fuck thing, she ain't my wife
So why I gotta pay for her for the rest of my life?

Child support? You're killin me! But it gets worse
Moms got a thirst that'll get her put in a hearse
Some say it's like a curse, the way she got me locked down
It feel like I'm trapped and I'm tryin to get out now
From the beginnin, shit was cool
Check it, a nigga was hungry and this bitch was food
And I, wanted to eat 'til the dog got full
Cause I knew how I felt and the things that I would do

Bust it! From the beginnin you had my mind goin
Look forward to seein you every time knowin
Couldn't see shit cause, love was blind
Fuck it, that liquor is what gets you blind

Pretty as they are but now so pale
You better leave all your worries far behind

Not long ago when you had the Fire
Burning inside of you brighter than any flame
You were the one that I believed in
Keeping our hopes up high where are you now?
Where do you aim?

Let me take you there
To the place you know
Why don't you Dream With Me

Now it is time to open your eyes again
See how all the sorrows have disappeared faded away
I am right here waiting for your call
If you still need me to guide your pace
Through the day

I'm ready to fight 'cause I want you back

When love goes to war
There's no happy ending
When love goes to war

Tears in the night wash over eyes filled with memories
Of your affections
Where do I stand I never planned on this misery
I need protection
You walk away so easily from the battle grounds
Of my emotions

All's fair in passion and war
But my disadvantage is I'm still in love

Through all these years that faith lives on, somehow

There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare and oh so hard to find

Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way

But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable is it to reach this far

For I know I hear a bittеrsweet song

We do have it in us

The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived

And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring

It had those English boys who had long hair.
When I was on my own they moved into my town,
and I just called 'em up and they'd be there.
In 1969 I had a lousy time.
I listened to the songs, read letters sent from Nam.
Now peace and love were gone, the tired soldiers home.
Ideal society gunned down the 70's.
Does it feel the same to you?
Why do you act the way you do?
Pack it up or pack it in.
There's no excuse.
Could the hands of time reverse?
Would we wake or take the ride
and again speak with one voice?
We knew each other well although we never met.
Messages passed to tell equal respect.
Coincidence recurred.
I had to laugh a lot.

It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-oh-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to ""One Love""
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'ma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, ""Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
and make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?""
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C.
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young hoe with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a hoe in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little hoe I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went ""Ahhh""
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a hoe
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
better move on somethin fast if I thought I
could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that hoe and y'all got fo' kids

Down under an oasis
Where there are dreams still being born
And summer spoke to winter
Relaying all encouraging words
And I was fully grateful mutant messages were heard
Moved on from my despondency and left it in the bed
Do I leave it there still sleeping
Or maybe kill it better yet?
For this is no time for depression
Or self-indulgent hesitance
This fucked up situation calls
For all hands, hands on deck

Freedom is as freedom does
And freedom is a verb
They giveth and they taketh
And you fight to keep that what you've earned
We saw the destination
Got so close before it turned
Swim sideways from this undertow
And do not be deterred

Floodlight dreams go drifting past
All the lives we could've had
Distant loves floating above
Close these eyes, they've seen enough

Caught the butterfly
Broke its wings then put it on display
Stripped of all its beauty
Once it could not fly high away
Oh, still alive like a passerby
Overdosed on gamma rays
Another god's creation
Destined to be thrown away
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse
They forged the north and west
Then you got Sitting Bullshit as our sitting president
Oh, talking to his mirror
What's he say, what's it say back?
A tragedy of errors
Who'll be the last to have a laugh?

His best days gone, hard to admit
Throwing angry punches with nothing to hit
Luminous thoughts were once all he had
Fading lights, lost eloquence
There's still a fire in the engine room
Knows relief will be coming soon

What's to be done?
Carve a path for rivers reign
Much to be done
Oceans rising with the waves, oh
Held by these thoughts
They refuse to slip away, oh
Hangman in dreamland
About to call your name

America is calling, let's care enough to give our very best.
For if we give our very best,
I know that we will more than pass the test.
If I could have three wishes, I'd wish that you'd live free,
I'd wish for amber waves of grain from sea to shining sea.

Yeah, let's do it for our country, the red, white, and the blue.
It's Uncle Sam who's asking, so your mother will approve.
Tomorrow I'll be fighting, and I'll win this war for you.
Let's do it for our country, our country wants us to.

Bullets are exploding, they'll soon be at the door,
Give something to America you never gave before.
Yeah, let's do it for our country, the red, white, and the blue,
If the President were standin' here, I'm sure he would approve.
I'll be a mighty soldier before this night is through.
Let's do it for our country, our country wants us to.

(Spoken)
Just think about it -- it would be like as if we were doing it for the Statue of Liberty, or the Grand Canyon, or the New York Yankees... it would be like as if we were doing it for... Disneyland!

Yeah, let's do it for our country, the red, white, and the blue,
It's not a lot to ask of us, our parents will approve.
Tomorrow I'll be fighting, and I'll win this war for you.
Let's do it for our country, (spoken) we owe it to our country.
Let's do it for our country, our country wants us to.

And when our work is over heaven with him we'll share

We'd like to welcome y'all to the fabulous Carolina West
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggaz know who I am y'all niggaz tearin up shit
But we got somethin old, and somethin new for y'all tongiht
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics

Verse One: Snoop Doggy Dogg

It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go
I'm hearin motherfuckers tryin to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'
Ya know, some of these niggaz is so deceptive
Usin my styles like a contraceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya havn't learnt
It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack
So put your gun away, run away, cuz i'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now
Tell me what's goin on
It make me wanna holler, cuz my dollars come in ozones
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
and quit tryin to spit at my motherfuckin hoes
Seakin of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cuz I rolled you a joint
You'se a flea and i'm the big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin paws
Y'alls, niggaz, better recognize
And see where I'm comin from it's still East Side till I die
Why ask why? As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-Y

Chorus:

It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World, it's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World

Verse Two: Kurupt

Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten
See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packin flavor like Life Savors
Ain't that somethin, talk shit and I'm dumpin
I had your whole fuckin block bumpin
Don't sweat, but check the tecnique, I'm unique like China
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin
I wanna see some panties droppin
I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
and I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
but it's manditory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action
You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog

Chorus

Verse Three: Daz

Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Tell when (till the early morn)
It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)
The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)

Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)
Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about
the city where I'm from, dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die

I got these niggas hating on me

These niggas gettin' sick
Somebody call a doctor
Cause all this blood's drippin' twenty racks on Louis Vuitton
I got Dolce and Gabanna
Gucci, Louis, Prada

Tell me now the jail like sayonara to you others

Wipe my ass with the riches

Memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet, my weary heart will beat

How glad I would be, æ†ˆwould mean so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again

Within the old home place, her patient smiling face
Was always spreading comfort, hope and cheer
And when she used to sing to her eternal king
It was the angels loved to hear

She used to pray that I, on Jesus would rely
And always walked the shining gospel way
So trusting still His love I seek that home above.
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day.

Her work on earth is done, the life crown has been won
And she will be at rest with Him above.
And some glad morning, she I know will welcome me.
To that eternal home of peace and love.

But I could see.
Within that situation everything’s a cross to bear.
I feel.
Some are in a coma,
Some are without sight.
You can feel the transformation in their bodies in the night.
Gone translucent, encircled in light

So bring back the lover’s chains.
No letters need reply.
Move over what remains.
Let us go kiss and fly.

Was only one solution that was in my head,
That I could see.
Spiritual confusion so more than I could stand,
I could feel.

Like someone in a coma,
Someone without sight.
Feel it in my body, feel it every night.
Gone translucent, encirled in light.

So bring back the lovers chains.
No need letters need reply.
Move over what remains.
And let us go kiss and fly.

Bring back the lovers arms,
Oh let me go deep inside.
Cool over all remains,
And let us go kiss and fly.

Kiss and fly,
kiss and fly.

That someday I would find a boy
And together we’d find joy

And he would care
About the color of the sky
About the things that make me cry

And if it happens this is what I'd say:

And I will give you my life
Together we'll make it right
And I will say to you
What is for sure
That I'll give you my world
And baby I'll be your girl
And I will say to you
Everything I have is yours

I wonder if
If God has shown him
He is the one whose gonna marry me

So, I'm gonna wait

And what I'm worth is so much more
For that someday

And the dawn broke grey and freezing through the deserted blocks
Just when your life is stale and there's reason there for everything
Something comes to kick you up inside
Eleven sweet years and no nearer home
A hundred thousands miles through this battle zone
Still high on the wire above the hollow darkness
Trying not to look down

No Rest for the wicked is still how it goes
Twisted up and turning in my bed alone
And separation pains like a blunted amputation
Pushing endless coins in the telephone
Eleven sweet years and no nearer home
A hundred thousands miles through this battle zone
Still high on the wire above the hollow darkness
Trying not to look down

So rest in these open arms and lie until they come for you
And tell me everything you've ever felt, tell me everything you want to see . .

Forever running even when we are standing still
Driven on and fired up as the whirlwinds blow
And shouting out inside ""I'm proud of you, I'm proud of you""

Eleven sweet years and no nearer home

/flunk/,Haldi,/flunk/haldi.html,"If our love is all that we have, caught up the sleeve
And if I choose, if I choose, the love that we share, would it be here
Keep coming to me, keep coming to me, I'll set you free
And if our love is to keep, if our love is the key, it's caught up my sleeve
All the love, all is love, so wipe out my heart, if you want to see
And if I call, if I call, would you be the one, the one that I seek
Keep coming to me, keep coming to me, I'll set you free
And if our love is to keep, if our love is the key, it's caught up my sleeve

Or so it's said, that the world of ours all lies in dreams
You got to keep them, out of reach for some
I wouldn't like to be the one, the one that you have hurt
So all appear to be as you see here
One too many, too many choices I have here
You've got to choose from the top of your head
I have one too many, too many reasons to be here
And that's what keeps me, so let it be
There are so many people and so much fuzz around us
They keep crashing, into a situation
And so they say, that the world of ours all lies in dreams
We got to keep them, real",en

Deep inside my heart you'll leave me never
Even if you took my heart
And tore it apart
I would love you still
Forever

You are the sun, you are my light
And you're the last thing on my mind
Before I go to sleep at night
You're always 'round
When I'm in need
When troubles on my mind
You put my soul at ease
There is no one in this world
Who can love me like you do
That is the reason that I
Wanna spend forever with you

Chorus 1:
I'll be loving you forever
Deep inside my heart you'll leave me never
Even if you took my heart
And tore it apart
I would love you still
Forever

We've had our fun
And we've made mistakes
But who'd have guessed along that road
We'd learn to give and take (learn to give and take)
It's so much more than I could have dreamed (I could have dreamed)
Cause you make loving you
So easy for me
There is no one in this world
Who can love me like you do
That is the reason that I
Wanna spend forever with you

Chorus 2:
I'll be loving you forever (forever)
Deep inside my heart you'll leave me never (don't ever leave)
Even if you took my heart (took my heart)
And tore it apart (and tore it apart girl)
I would love you still
Forever
And girl I pray you leave me never

Cuz this is the world, where lovers often go astray (often go astray)
But if we love each other
We won't go that way
So put your doubts aside
Do what it takes to make it right
I love you, forever, no one can tear us apart

They speak with their bodies and they talk with their eyes

They cling to each other and lie there silently

But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Don't you know
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play the game, a fantasy
I pretend but I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
to make me feel better
So let's stay together

I got your memories hanging on my wall
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Well written topic
Broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce
Words so profuse
It's abuse how I juice up this beat
Like I'm deuce
Two people both equal
Like I'm Gemini
Rather simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it
You can't stop it
Drop it
Your whole crew's microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles
And on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother business
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness
First handed I'm candid
You can't stand it
Respect demanded
And get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel
And this is real
So I keep makin' the street's ballads
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad

You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour (x2)

I'm about to change the focus
From the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus
To reverse the hypnosis
Whoever's closest
To the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall tryin to ball
While my team win the pennant
I'm about to be in it
For a minute
Then run for senate
Make a slum lord be the tenant
Give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it
Every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival
Documented in the bible
Like Moses and Aaron
Things gon change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna
Be seen through
Let God redeem you
Keep your deen true
You can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to
Observe how a queen do
And I remain calm readin' the 73 Psalm
Cause wit all this on I got the world in palm

You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour(x2)

Pay no mind party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela
Singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture
Or collectin' residuals from off the Score
I'm makin' sure
I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle this is war
Word to Boonie
I make salaat like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from
Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop
It's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks
you can't capsize this ship
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip

All the faces are filled with so much anger
Losing our dignity and hope from fear of danger
After all the wars, after settling the scores
At the break of dawn we will be deaf to the answers

There's so much bigotry, misunderstanding and fear
With eyes squinted and fists clinched
We reach out for what is dear
We want it we want

Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels

So many nations with so many hungry people
So many homeless scrounging around for dirty needles
On the rise, teen suicide, when we will realize
We've been desensitized by the lies of the world
We're oppressed and impressed by the greedy
Whose hands squeeze the life out of the needy
When will we learn that wars, threats
And regrets are the cause and effect of living in fear

Who can help protect the innocence of our children
Stolen on the internet with images they can't forget
We want it we want
We want a reason to live
We represent a generation
That wants to turn back a nation
To let love be our light and salvation
We need it we need

We need more than this
I became a savior to some kids
I'll never meet
Sent a check in the mail to buy them
Something to eat
What will you do to make a difference
To make a change?

What will you do to help someone along the way?
Just a touch, a smile as you turn the other cheek
Pray for your enemies, humble yourself
Love's staring back at me
In the midst of the most painful faces
Angels show up in the strangest of places",en

She's both surrender and fight
She wears her heart on her clothes

She walks the walls like a ghost

Her life way ahead of its time
This town's too small for 'em both

This rap here... it may cause concern it's
broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love mean happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... and it's cool to look bummy
and be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid goin wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non cool... your life, don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves... hey they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too

And it's true

We like to party, like to party""

But you don't have a nickle... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
plus, a must so... bigshot you're not
Your friends are talkin and I'm hearin that your girls are what?
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob
You see you're actin like this urge is demandin
C'mon, wake up... have some understandin
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you deep
Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
so be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate hate hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, cause that's a man... that's brains no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

""You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party""

Hey young world, the world is yours
Hey young world...

When I can find the meanings of my life
I descend into the maelstrom of my darkest side
No one can hear me while I ask aloud to the face of this horror

What does it take to be a man, harder than before
to cry your tears and not afraid to let them show
What does it take to face your inner demons, with no words left untold
What does it take to be a stronger man (when the Tempest in raging on)
What does it take to be a real man
Tempest calling now

I talk to the Tempest, for the last time
Standing in front of her, my arms open wide
She opens her jaws now and flashes her teeth
""Son, it's my turn now to speak""

Over and over, day after day
I fed on the power of your inner self
I am the maelstrom of your darkest side
I have no answer and you will not care
When I will crash you and wipe you away

Don't look for a reason, it doesn't matter anyway
You must face the Tempest, don't try to step aside
When the storm rages harder, it's your time to fight

And a thousand blades were flashin'

Far above their shining weapons
Hung their own immortal green

Foreign strike the marchin' tune
And hurrah me boys for Ireland

Well, they fought for poor old Ireland
And full bitter was their fate
Oh what glorious pride and sorrow
Fill the name of ninety-eight
Yet thank God while hearts are beating

to check to check to check? First place, no neck and neck

Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these
I knew I lived this life back
when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop

Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like ""man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother""
But that's on some other shit, look

Thou shall not steal,

confused and full of questions.

or is this just a lesson.
And who it's goin' choose
when it gets turned around.
And will it be
layin' in my own blood

I've watched you grow up
and I've been there. (uh huh)

you least suspected it
I was there.
And look at what I've given you
a talent to rhyme.
I may not come when you call,
but I'm always on time.

Should I let em in.
Lord we're just startin,
but where will it end.

No!
Put down the guns
and write a new rhyme.
You'll get it all in due time.
You'll do fine.
Just have faith
cuz you mine. (uh huh)
And when you shine
it's goin' be a sight to behold.
So don't fight to be old,
or lose sight when it's cold.
See that light down the road,
it's goin' guide you there
Two sets of footprints,
I was right beside you there.

But what about them times I
only saw one.
Those were the times that I was
under the gun,

It was then I carried you my son.
Led you to safety.
It just wasn't your time to face me. (uh huh)

Ayo a few of them times I thought you would erase me.
But all you did was embrace me.
Prepared me for the worst.
Offered me eternal light,
and scared me with the hearse.
And the curse
turned to grace.
When the hurt
turned to faith.
No more runnin', (uh huh)
and slidin' in the dirt
cuz I'm safe.

Somebody's knockin'.
Should I let em in.
Lord we're just startin,
but where will it end.
Somebody's knockin'.
Should I let em in.

So if I'm yo' man
I'm in yo' hand.
Wus yo' plan.
Never had a friend
cuz you couldn't trust your man.
Learned to stand before I crawled.
Things were twisted!
And if you showed me anything at all
then I missed it.
Looked the wrong way. (uh huh)
I've done some wrong things. (true)
Kept a bad attitude,
but that's what wrong brings.
And now you mean to tell me that
after all this time,
it was you that kept the dog from goin' out of his mind.
It was you that breathed life
into my lungs when I was born.
And it was you that let me know
what was right,
from what was wrong.
And it was you that let me do
what I knew what could be done.
And it was you that gave me a good wife
and a beautiful son.
And It's been you speakin' to me
inside my mind.
And it's been you who has forgiven
time after time.
It was you who opened my eyes
so I could see.
And it was you who shined yo'
light on me.

Man believe me you're pissed
I'm a crazy introvert
With a mind full of words I define grey sounds
And I go from zero
To one hundred kilohertz real quick
Space age the greatest thing up
In this universe
If you heard the fire from 20
You will definitely burn

I'm not the same person I used to know
In a good way

But I believe in winning I mean it

Just let me write my rhymes
In search for something I might never find
How the fuck can you tell me
That this ain't what you needed
Put your ass back in line
And listen up when I'm speaking
They be preaching that bullshit
And still don't know the meaning
Alien life
I don't really fuck with human beings
Homosapiens as a race we're failing
Try and cover up all the messages
You're portraying
Socialites are lost
And just tryna look for a way in
How can you ignore all this greatness
That I'm displaying
How can you be sure
That you're what people are playing
Man I passed caring about
What niggas are saying
Call up my lawyer and say
These lables are corny
They should know what
They're doing from artists that came before me
Still they struggle
To know how to handle young simz
'cause I can't be handled
Step in my space you get dismantled
This isn't banter
This is that crowd-put your hands up
Thoughts are still distorted
I say always, man I've been zoning all day

I will not conform
To what they want me to conform to
I was born alone I die alone
These thoughts are deranged
Sometimes I don't care
You think I'm a human I think I'm an alien
Still I say

Everybody leave me the fuck alone!
I won't drown in my sorrow!
Everybody leave me the fuck alone!
Leave me alone
Leave me

(2x)

Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan of citizen bystands
But shit is in my hands, here's your life span
For what your life's worth this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'
I want the whole plot, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets ya description an' sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cuz I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell an' hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin' for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' ""Freeze!""
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest

CHORUS 2x

Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out
Need a backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut ya yackin' mouth before I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove in thru somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin': ""Son, go in and call the police
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a nick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And colliding with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin' ""TRUCE TRUCE!""
Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me! It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnopps

The son of God by name


""Fear not,"" then said the angel
""Let nothing you affright
This day is born a saviour
Of a pure virgin bright
To free all those who trust in him
From Satan's pow'r and might""


The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightaway
This blessed babe to find


But when to Bethlehem they came
Whereat this infant lay
They found him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His mother Mary kneeling
Unto the Lord did pray


Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface

The Earth and the sky
What too long
And what too high

Nothing there at all

Dropped and lifted
Gotta breathe
Bottom drifting
On the way
Holding just a few poor words
And nothing at all

Reaching out
To still the sand
No light connects
The breaking moments
Drifting to another shore
There's nothing here
That I could change at all
Nothing at all

Forced to be
A broken line
Let to hold
What we could find
Then to learn
And go again
Nothing sorted out

It drifts about
The dead volcano

And who's to find

Tenderfoot By Smudge (or a Lemonheads cover song)
written by Tom Morgan (Smudge) and Adam Young (Daisygrinders)
Tab by Louisa Sher (verve@dot.net.au) and B.Pemberton

The thing that throws you most in this song is the bass part
which plays G F# E pattern on the E string
This can be incorporated into the guitar part nicely
But that confuses the tab a bit, so do that yrself at home...

Right by your side together we'll wait out of the storm

Just stand firm for all you believe

Is living a life true to yourself, it's your choice

Brings us an umbrella and lends a hand
Let's hope that we soon have the same opportunity
When we help our fellow man

A treasure to find, brings a smile to my face
Shake off all your troubles, they roil right off your back

I will search, I will find where you are

Shines so bright, like a jewel within our hearts

Now that I can see it's so clear to me
Appreciate the beauty that you bring
With you here by my side, feel the warmth of your smile
Glows like a rainbow in the sun

A treasure to find, brings a smile to my face

Explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin out Chryslers, easywider paper
Pops puffin his sess, punchin his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon and Chungo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin
Livin carefree laughin, got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin like some old folks y'all don't hear me

Yo, dude is 31, livin in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin, got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin L's
in the same spot he stood since, eighty-five well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
with young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth, he's in his second childhood

Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin
E poppin Ecstasy takin, won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin, stuck with limitations
Lustin men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel
With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin, mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person, never matures
All her friends married doin well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right, polite, guess she's in her second childhood

Everywhere I go
I have to turn around
Watch my back, watch my front
That's what it's all about

Where they bang
The world's so big yet so small
It's one block

And cruise the One Hundred Twenty Fifth street
Music loud as hell in my jeep
Eyes meet people, strangers
Not thinkin' of danger
Amongst my people
Some I see through
But one guy stares
Maybe he thinks he knows me
Or maybe he's crazy
Killer, baller, dealer
Something he has he wants to show me
But I'm at this red light
Is it me or is he looking dead right
In my face?
As I pull the strap that I keep
Underneath the seat
Just in time
I was able to fled the scene
And leave him standing there
With his hands in the air
See, my life is green
Harlem to Queens
Triborough bridge packed with cars
Trucks, vans and cabs
They got this new EZ Pass Thing
Computer, taking over the cash thing
So as I drive home
I roll my window up
And my endo up in the same motion
See life is so full of surprises
And as I paid my toll
I drove to see my man
""What up kid, Dunn, brova?
Whats the deal?""
He said
""Everything's easy bro'er man
It's all real""
I said
""But what happened earlier
Why everybody outside?""
He said like
""Blue suits came runnin' through
And took thirty brothas for a ride
Yo, right after you left the Ave""
Yo, the same thing that's been going on
Since I was young in the past
Still goes on, how long will it last?
Gotta get strong fast
Out in the jungle
Jungle
That's how it is
Olu, got the music playing
Outside it ain't no playing
We just paying attention
Listening now to everything that's happening
Cause if it's on it's on
And it's always on
It's just like this song ""Jungle""

fell in love once and almost completely
she's in love with the world
but sometimes these feelings
can be so misleading

mellow roll for the flavor
and the eyes for peeping
can't keep away from the girl
these two sides of my brain
need to have a meeting

my left brain knows that
all love is fleeting
she's just looking for something new

I get high a lot ain't got much to do
I'm always in a daze
That was just a dream I had last night in my bubble bath
Next to my wishing well

Get up get out and do somethin
Don't let the days of your life pass you by
Get up get out and do somethin
How will you make it if you never even try?
Get up get out and do somethin

I'm further behind now than I was back then
Lost in some ole maze
Some years have passed me by
All I want is to go get high
I'll get it together some other day

In my dreams I dwell cuz all my dreams are swell
And you would too, if you could see them
That's when I know

What was on the horizon
Forewarned yall
Is it any wonder
What kind of ground you goin under
A September ender
To march madness remember?
You never heard a murder
Take for example
Unsolved mystery
Life lost in a funk sample
Enter the bandwagons
Braggin hangin banners
Clearin the way for younger MCs
And new hammers
What was criticized six years back
Is now back
With New York on the jersey front and back
Feel like Tiger Woods
Got madd goods
Way up from the cheap seats
Comin outta the hood
Race to the black seats
Amongst the wack seats
Be the hardcore
Alongside the deadbeats
The world lookin on
Like spectators
At crucified gladiators
Feels like a jungle inside
Where fish swim birds fly
Man got a tendency to die
Man falls to the hands of man
But damn if i'll ever try
To survive at courtside
Four tickets to fly
Rap or play ball do the game
Or duck the drive by

Same league that defends
Be the same ones that do us in

Raised by peeps rode jeeps
Deep in Brooklyn beats
Praised as a hero
Who came up off the streets

Claimin sides they don't own
A house built up on
Their skulls and bones
Knew it be a matter of time
The play by play
Two rappers slain

Gettin bigger
Proud to be called a bunch

Hip hop shoot outs vs those house negros
Five bodies got on the shot clock
Runnin down in the count made

Not only in the game
But the game behind the game

Anatomy of a murder
Intensity of a mystery

But I roll through your fuckin hood and regulate it
Cause I wasn't born to be broke, I let the .45th smoke
Before I let my baby boy go under, no wonder
I'm addicted to the cash flow, stacks of green
Flashback, I'm nudgin weights down a triple beam
I'ma make the loot loop

As fast as I spend it
I'm tryin to get back in it
I make the loot loop
It's cop and blow
Nigga, that's all I know
I make the loot loop
As fast as I spend it
I'm tryin to get back in it
I make my loot loop

I'm tryin to make my bank roll bigger

I must admit, I got a lust for loot, quick to shoot
Ostrich, fruits and Austin Martin coupes
Fill my dreams with cream, I got wet sheets
I'm bustin nuts over currency, kid, fuck freaks
We be the niggas in the back of the club with the Moé›
Bitches, shrimps, mackin like pimps
Wearin fly shit you never seen before (raw)
I turn a angel to a whore, now need I say more?
My perm got bounce, fuck a 40 ounce
I'm sippin Cristal, pal, and represent I shall
To the end of the game
(That nigga Ice got fame)
And just not over these beats
But on the 4-wheel streets
I make the loot loop

[ VERSE 3 ]
Say what you will, I'm the fool on the hill
With the pool, jaccuzzi, laser-beam Uzi
Niggas in LA know the Ice don't play
I'm just a savage for the cabbage and a pimp parlay
I rock a million with the jewels on the paw (don't start)
Cause my niggas ain't the big ones, just big guns
Pushin the limits of this game till I gets my piece
I put my true queen Darlene in a white Corniece
So stay broke if you wanna, hang out on your corner
Step back from the curb when we roll up on ya
20 black cars all tinted, we meant it
'Syndicate forever - posse of the clever'
Rubberbands strap the fat green knots
We're strictly hustlers not gangsters, but we still lick shots
For the goal
Peace, I'm out like Nicole

Rolled out of bed
And went out to change the world
Her head on his shoulder
He settles her down
It all started over and over again

His mom made him breakfast
He gets on the bus
Goes out to see the world
He lies on the ground, wipes blood from his nose
Wonders why he's the one that doesn't fit in

The pictures he drew
But if only they told him
You're never gonna be like anyone
And that's okay
Give into your feelings
Don't give in to the ones that will own ya
Sometimes they just don't go away

Six double Martinis, a night on the town
It sure makes the mornings long
He never imagined a life time like this would be
The only thing to let him get in to

You're never gonna be like anyone

He falls down
Wishes he could get the nerve to end it all now

And he slams it down
And swallows another

Taking one step forward slipping two steps back

Made a motion to repeal.
You kicked my legs from under me,
And tried to take the wheel.

The basket of America, the weevils and the wheat.
The milk and honeyed congregation, scrubbed and apple-cheeked
Salute Apollo 13 from the rattle jewelry seats.

That I have just begun to understand.

A rumble in the third act, tie 'em up and burn 'em down.

We can't approach the Allies 'cause they seem a little peeved
And speak a language we don't understand.

God gave us the upper hand, there's honor among thieves.
Temper it with arrogance, a dash of sad conceit.

I'm seein' through her eyes like cellophane
It used to be I'd see her face and feel so small
Now the only face I see is the picture
I'm throwing darts at on the wall

Where did she go? When loneliness is all I had to show
If I couldn't trust her then, who could I trust?
The pillow is wet with tears and permanent rust

Just when I thought I was out of the dark
I'm holding her tight and she breaks the light

She was dead in my mind, but her ghost is still around
It comes back to haunt me, it doesn't want me
It just happened to be passing through my town
It took so long to realize the truth
I resent every word I said...
That's when I knew, one and one don't make two!

I knew that sleepless night when she never came home
She's probably drinking somewhere knowing I'm alone
The road to nowhere is a long winding street
Maybe someone will be there at the end,
But it won't be me!

And every time she smile it make me feel like a child
In the supermarket in the candy aisle
I saw a picture of her wit her panties down
I fall asleep and dream I’m a camera now
I would love to be the water in her shower
Or one of her bath towels
I told her I would write a rhyme about her, and it wud be sweet
I said “I need the perfect track,” she said “thas deep”
I worked on it all nite, didn’t get no sleep
Now here is my song, and this is the beat
This is the beat
This this is the beat
And here is my song about lisa marie
She she she said her name was lisa marie
Li-lisa marie, li-lisa marie
Li-lisa marie, li-lisa marie
Li-lisa marie, li-lisa marie
Li-lisa marie, li-lisa marie

She said her name was lisa marie
And she was a piece
A piece of fine art like a piece of Lalique
She was unique, exquis-ite
Like X Y Z, she was complete
And I think she like butterflies,
Because she got one on her upper thigh
And her face is like summertime
Birthday the same month of mine,
With a different sign
Virgo, I go wherever her go
If she say so, I’m on her like a fur coat
In November she colder than December
She got me fallin like timber
I told her I would write a rhyme about her, and it wud be sweet
I said “I need the perfect track,” she said “thas deep”
I worked on it all nite, didn’t get no sleep
Now here is my song, and this is the beat

This is the beat
This this is the beat
And here is my song about lisa marie
She she she said her name was lisa marie
Li-lisa marie, li-lisa marie

Kindergarten people, they used 'em they need 'em
The over indulgent machines were their children
And there wasn't a way down on earth here to cool 'em
Cos they look just like humans at Kresge's and Woolworths
But decadent brains were at work to destroy
Brats in batallions were ruling the streets and
Generation landslide, close the gap between them

Militant mothers hiding in the basement
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink highchairs
While mothers' lib burns birth certificate papers
And dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance
Sister's out til 5, doing banker son's hours
But she owns a Mazarotti that's a gift from his father
Stop at full speed, at 100 miles per hour
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em

And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies

Cos just getting home from school safe is a gamble and a blessing

Bored with one another, like old broken Christmas toysies

Aimlessly the nameless and the faceless go to make up

And my life does not rely on how much love

Remembering more instead
You send me door to door
To have the family cat attack the strangers
Back by popular demand, stand as you were
Before you saw your parting gift in stores
You poured your empty heart in it
But finished what you started
When you practiced and rehearsed
To find your god before he finds first
In dirty words and poison dreams
Like girls who flirt
while boys are teens
They're only asking for one thing
It's never only make believe to me

Tell me I'm spending too much time on happy endings

Broke out from your crib rushin' to get here
Tripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs
Jumped into your ride pushed the speed to the limit
Jumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it
Now you're at the jam but in for a shock
Stupid big line wrapped around the block
Through the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme
Methodically you schemed a way to cut in line
But when you got inside the sight straightened your curls
Cause as you look around all you could see were girls

I love ladies

I think it's time that I tell the truth
I been dissin' females since my early youth
But you know that's a drag and there's no doubt
Cause females are the one thing that I can't do without
Female companionship is my one vice
I love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice
Homeboys you must admit the best part of each day
Is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way
Females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have
Not that hangs around me
They got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it
They shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it
We try to supress it until they undress it
And beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it
No man can deny it so don't even try it!!!

Don't dig goin' to the movies alone
Or talkin' to myself on the telephone
Goin' to a disco that's packed with men
That's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen
Walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys
And a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes
And man if females are one thing that you don't need
You better get away from me at a high rate of speed
Cause if you don't like them you must like men
And homeboy that's where our serious problems begin
Because to me women are God's true gift
There's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with

I seen this fly girl walkin' down the street
Jammin' a box rockin' to the beat
The girl looked pretty, she really looked nice
So I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice
Walked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme
She said ""Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind""
I kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth
The next thing I knew I was at her house
Looked at her closely, said for goodness sake
The girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake
Her top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell
I knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well
But then she started talkin' mess about love and romance
Until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants
You should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded
She grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded
My knees started knockin', I tried to run
She said ""Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come""
This girl meant business I had no doubt
This is just about the time that the Ice passed out
The next day I woke the girl was through
Room still smokin', my legs black and blue
My eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight
My knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight
She was the best y'all, yes on this earth
I would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth
If I had got her name or number it would'a been nice
But I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice

No when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how
When I ask for a reply they always scream owww!!

Sometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill
Maybe they scared if they say ho!
They might lose their cool
But I got some news for you: a fool's a fool
But don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock
They put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top
They start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins
They don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins
They don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance
They did not come with no intention to party or dance

As she walks about the room
Her hair falls down her breast
She is naked and it is June

Standing at the window
I wonder if she knows that I can see

Watching Alice rise year after year
Up in her palace, she's captive there

Alice's body
Is golden brown
Her hair hangs down
As she stoops to conquer me
First she pulls her stocking on
And then the church bell chimes
Alice climbes into her uniform
The zippers on the side
Watching Alice dressing in her room

The winter of your discontent
Came twenty years too late

Descending marble stairs

A-yo Ice, man. I'm working on this term paper for college. What's the
First Amendment?
Verse 1
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfuckin' bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says ""Profanity - No Airplay""?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get
Verse 2
[You have the right to remain silent]
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
Verse 3
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said ""Fuck""
So I thought for a minute and said ""No,
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show""
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map
Verse 4
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
Outro (Jello Biafra)
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarron-Walter
Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're
protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or
whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down,
what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information
itself.
If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it.",en

Yesterday was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday I saw your smiling face
Love walked through my door

One precious moment changed my life
One tender kiss made everything alright
One touch from you and this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever

Cried my first tears of joy last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you

Felt the sun shine so bright on me
Chased the rain from my heart
Through a storm, through the darkest night
I found my brightest star

One magic moment made one magic night
I fell in love with one look in your eyes
I never knew I could feel so alive
Darling, in your arms I could feel forever

Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day,
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,
The ox and ass and camel which adore.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.

What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.",en

With the light too bright for my senses
From this hiding place, life was way too much
It was loud and rough round the edges
So I faced the wall when an old man called
Out of dreams that I would die there
But a sight unseen, you were pulling strings
And you had a different idea

I was like a child, I was light as straw
When my father lifted me up there
Took me to a place where they checked my body
My soul was floating in thin air
I clung to the bed, and I clung to the past
And I clung to the welcome darkness
But at the end of the night
There's a green green light
It's the quiet before the madness
There was a girl that sang like the chime of a bell
She put out her arm and she touched me when I was in hell

Someone sang a song and I sang along
Cause I knew the words from my childhood
Intellect, ambition they fell away
They locked me up for my own good
But I didn't mind cause the silence was kind
And you spoke to me in whispers
There was the sound of the wind in the cold cold dawn
And the quiet hum of business
Let me dangle a while in this waiting room
I don't need to go I don't need to know what your doing

Lying on my side you were half awake and your face was tired and crumpled
If I had a camera I'd snap you now cos there's beauty in every stumble
We are out of practise we're out of sight
On the edge of nobody's empire
If we live by books and we live by hope
Does that make us targets for gunfire?

Now I look at you you're a mother of two
You're a quiet revolution
Marching with the crowd singing dirty and loud
For the people's emancipation
Did I do ok, did I pave the way
Was I strong when you were wanting
I was tied to the yoke with a decent bloke
Who was stern but never daunting
And he told me to push and he made me feel well
And he told me to leave that vision of hell to the dying",en

Forever black, eternal light!

Mama when my dollies have babies
And I am a big lady
Mama will a prince come and take me away

When I said these things I believed in kings
Then I didn't know love could hurt me so
Slowly she replied, tears had filled her eyes
Baby not so fast let your young life last

Chorus

I sang to her in fun, my teens had just began
My age was not the same still we played the game
Her eyes were filled with pride and slowly she replied
Soon enough you'll be a very pretty bride

Chorus

Mama, will the hurt go away deep inside
When I sang this song
My poor world had gone along
All my early dreams has turned to crystal streams
My love it was last and more tears have past
And left me just one thing a tender voice I sing

Put your money down
Take your choice
That’s the way it is
Every time with these boys
And you sense no shame
And you feel no disgrace
Somebody wins
Somebody loses
It’s a dirty dirty race
Oh my life
It’s a dog’s life

One empty monday
Out of the blue
Took a good luck turn
Started something new

Out of the gutter
Out of the rain
Out of my head
And I’m feeling no pain
Oh my life/feeling no pain
Take the strain
It’s a dog’s life

Ducking in the shadows
Diving in the dark
Rolling with the punches
Striking at the heart
Touching all the sense’s
Breaking those taboos
Bursting at the seams
Blowing all my fuses

The turning of a page
The burning of a book
(if you’re) talking out of turn
(it’s) just the way you look

When the time is right
But the shape is wrong
And you find yourself
Where you don’t belong

Back to reality
Back on the line
Back into this and you’ll feel no pain
You wanna do it one more time
We can do it once again
Oh my life
It’s a dog’s life

Ooh that was nice Ready

Hey man, hold up man
I think I wanna tell em a little about this man
Aight break it down Ready, break it down

Please pay attention, to my rhymes so I can tell you all about this pal of mine
He's my buddy, my best friend
When it's a beat I need it's a beat he'll lend
I wanna take time-out, to talk about him
Cause frankly I don't know what I would do without him
We work together like a medical crew
When I'm backin Ready up (I'm backin Prince up too)
Tryin to beat us, that doesn't make any sense
He's Ready Rock C, and I'm the Fresh Prince
In the rap industry we're ranked at first
Ain't a better combination in the whole universe
So if you wanna battle your future looks muddy
That you just can't beat, my buddy

Word, break it down break it down Ready

We've won so many battles, people think it's a trick
That when the crowd gets to judge it's US that they'll pick
They see Ready's face and then they hear my voice
To choose us as the winners is the natural choice
Because battle after battle we remain on top
Cause it's not the way we look, it's the way that we rock
So if you thought you wanted to battle, bust this rhyme
Just keep it and I'm sure that I can change your mind
There was ten wack dudes trying to play high post
One crew got bold and they began to boast
But said, Y'all shut up and get back in line
But they refused (what happened now) So now there's nine
Nine wack crews tryin to rock like this
They were bitin my rhymes and just couldn't resist
I said please stop bitin, please don't imitate
But they kept on bitin, so there's now there's eight
Eight wack crews poppin big time trash
Telling us that in a battle we can't last
The battle started at 10:30 and by quarter of eleven was no longer eight crews (how many was their)
There was seven
Seven wack cruise in a football huddle
Trying to figure out their next rebuttal
They came out strong you'd think their The Ultimate but we just dissed em and dismissed, so now there's six
Six wack groups, tryin to be tough
Who the hell told em they could rock the mic like us
We got straight down the business didn't pop no jive
We just blew em out, so now there's five
Five wack crews lined up in the hallway
All perpetrating like they're read to play
My secretary walked out, she asked for one more
They got scared, and left, so now there's four
Four wack crews outside playing around
I said I'll take you wall on, now how does that sound?
Not one had heart enough to pick up that mic
I said, okay I'll let you go, psych
That's the moral, of this story
Never try to take me and Ready Rock's glory
Cause if you do your future looks muddy
Cause you just can't beat me and my buddy

Screaming throw myself in fury

Who knows what makes it start?
One day it's simply there,
Alive inside in your heart.
It slips into your thoughts,
It infiltrates your soul,
It takes you by surprise,
Then seizes full control.
Try to deny it,
And try to protest,
But love won't let you go,
Once you've been possessed.

Love never dies.
Love never falters.
Once it has spoken,
Love is yours.
Love never fades.
Love never alters.
Hearts may get broken,
Love endures...
Hearts may get broken,
Love endures.

And soon as you submit,
Surrender flesh and bone,
That love takes on a life much bigger than your own.
It uses you at whim and drives you to despair.
And forces you to feel more joy than you can bear.
Love gives you pleasure,
And love brings you pain!
And yet, when both are gone,
Love will still remain.

Once it has spoken,

She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cuz she said ""Remember when...
This was all a silly dream?""
Now I wake up every day
In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said ""all the world's a stage""
But girl you know,
Those cameras n lights won't ever change me

I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door

It's amazin' to hear people singin' along
Hear the radio playin' my song
I still get butterflies
Still get nervous inside
In the spotlight
Now every now n then
On a Friday night
Cruisin' down to the dive bar
We waste the night away
Spend Saturday sleepin' in late
Those were the good days

I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door

And even when I'm miles away
I'll always have the roots from where I came
'Cuz when it all fades away
My home will still be the same, yeah eh yeah

I don't drink champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We sip on tea on the porch
'Cuz I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour

And endless search for those who've not
Paid for their delinquent way
Cause personal catastrophes

That doing good is fine
But don't expect to find your plate full
Because the Karma Patrol is blind to the fact
Except that no one's perfect all the time
Raining down, walking home
When they come, you will know
All looks good, mind your way
Now you're going to pay

No matter what you do
And the water will come down

Or you'll get soaked straight through
To the bone

They have no preference for the good or the evil

Came upon the shore
Found you were conquering America

But waged a war

And people to kill
While you were conquering America

Did God's will

While you're conquering America
Taking rockets to the moon

I found this photograph,
Underneath the broken picture glass
Tender face of black and white,
Beautiful, a haunting sight
Looked into an angel's smile,
Captivated all the while
From the hair and clothes she wore,
I'd place her in between the wars

Was she willing when she sat
And posed the pretty photograph?
Save her flowering and fair,
The days to come, the days to share
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

I found this photograph,
Stashed between the old joist walls,
In a place where time is lost,
Lost behind, where all things fall
Broken books and calendars,
Letters script in careful hand,
Music too, a standard tune by
Some forgotten big brass band

From the threshhold what's to see
Of our brave new century?
The television's just a dream,
The radio, the silver screen
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

Was her childhood filled with rhymes,
Stolen hooks, impassioned crimes?
Was she innocent or blind
To the cruelty of her time?
Was she fearful in her day,
Was she hopeful, did she pray?
Were there skeletons inside,
Family secrets, sworn to hide?
Did she feel the beat that stirs,
The fall from grace of wayward girls?
Was she tempted to pretend,
The love and laughter, 'til the end?

The only name that I really know

Tell me did he think of me
At a drop of rain, or when you see
When it rakes as it moves across the water
Judgement comes when I'm all alone
Like a spyglass on the furthest coast
Favored now that it's left behind

When you talk to me you could swallow me

Nighttime brings me a place I fear
Where I hear your words and feel you near
Fingers only to find a frozen memory
Sometimes clothes chosen long ago
A direction down a gravel road
Makes you wish you could take him back

I go straight to you and find you down
Kneeling next to the water where I left you
Knee-deep now in the creek I made
From the landscape lost I want to save
Save it now or be punished more

Let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating
And I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes
Trying to see into your mind
See into your soul
See, no limits to the levels
Me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you
That make me wanna change
I like the way you dancing
And the way you play the game
I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it
Not saying a thing
The way you got me going
Got me going outta my brains
I see us going at it
Going in and out of them lanes

I don't want your innocence
I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment
And I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number

I want you to come up

Look how I studied every move, now I know you

And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me

So I’m sitting in the crib just chillin and I’m minding my business
got a text with a tongue out from a number I didn’t recognize
I replied who is this
quick back got a hit back
said this is Stacy and I’ve been missing you
had to change my number so I went and got a new phone and new tattoo
a what, a new tattoo wow,
arrr yeaah, hurry click
can you send a nasty pic
so I can see right where it is
and I promise I won’t show my friends (yeah right)
she replied, well ok BTW by the way
SMH its such a shame that you aint learned a damn thing
[Chorus]
[Ludacris - Verse 3]
So I pull up to the club stunting in a Yellow Lamborghini
half bent, black tint, fine p-ssy it make it a little hard to see me
stepped out, fresh out headed straight for the door and to the VIP
next thing I got a text from a freaky Latina saying is that you I see
is that you papi
so I bbm’ed abbreviate yep and before the night gets too late
lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
let me hit you with a little Q&A
can I tap that ass tta
she replied it all depends
it’s me plus one can I bring my friends
and all I can think was that it’s such a shame
that I aint learned a damn thing

No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do

Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing

Couldn't match my claims so they compare me to a mason

Brought me thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished

And keep my n*ggas from goin' away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly sh*t when we got big
Chasin' these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat n*ggas up so bad 'bout it they go blind about it

Hot to death, though in tenth grade a teenage mom
Knocked up by some thug named Russ in the drug game
But had the cutest kid you ever seen
Then all the pressure from her mom
She stepped to Russ
Told him it's either them drugs or us
Either them thugs or us
The ultimatum, either continue bein a thug in the world
Or start lovin your girl
And say God, bear me witness, no doubt, lovin ya dear
But to go from $50 Gees a week to $30 Gees a year
That ain't happenin
I guess he wasn't that strong
He came back the next week, and the whole family was gone
Yo they straight moved away, without as little as a word
Well, needless to say, Russ was a little perturbed
Then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend Shawn
And like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone

Upstate Schenectady,
Tamika answered the door
It was the last person she expected to be
They just stared
He said you love me for me?
You can do without the cars, vacations, and jewelry?
Down with me?
Period.
Through life's stress and strife
She said, Yeah, He said in that case
Would you please be my wife?
Then like a sign from the sky, the baby cried
Like an angel sings
I love y'all more than anything

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from Orient land
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend.

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.

These niggas wanna see me
Cuz of the way I shine
But it aint that easy
To get mine
You get ya ass laid down

Down…
The paint is peelin’
Now…
When the chips are down
Down…
You kinda lose all feelin
Now…
Your head goes round n’ round

Funny how the world revolves around my click
Cuz just a year ago a nigga ain’t have shit (damn)
Me and my right hand share the same outfit
Which fueled the fire that I air the game out with (whoo)
It’s amazing the way that boy came out quick
For that platinum niggas’ll blows ya brains out, shit (bap)
I’m the new nigga the others can’t stand
The rubberband man be god damned if I can (oh)
Let another nigga fill my spot
If a niggas steal from me it’s the steel I pop
I’m on my grind so if you thought I chill, I’m not
gon' stop lettin that steering peel on the block, why not?

[Chorus x2]
Down…
The paint is peelin’

Banks they think I’m yayos replacement, nah
I borrowed his gunits to walk through the matrix
I’m signed to the Doctor I ain’t got no patience
So he put me with 50 Cent now I got a face lift
Magazines wanna know where they fuck L.A. been
It almost died in the same car Suge got grazed in
2001 I was playin my playstation
I heard 9 shots , I’m face down with my heart pacing
All I could think about as hidin’ my gun and my drugs in the basement
It was either that or the state pen
I woke up out of that coma
Police waitin’ for a statement…(heart monitor beeps to flatline)

[Chorus]
Down…
The paint is peelin’
Now…
When the chips are down
Down…
You kinda lose all feelin
Now…
Your head goes round n’ round

The paint is peelin’
Now…
When the chips are down
Down…
You kinda lose all feelin
Now…

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]

Pass the weed and let a nigga get into a zone
Papa left me all alone in the world to roam
But now I’m grown, millionaires on my cell phone
A year past now, caw dead and L gone
And I’m sick, bought chopper with a long click
So think about that before you make your songs dick (dick)
Or lose a limb, please don’t get me confused with him (uh uh)
Cause I’m down to go a whole round, lose or win
If I should die, ride a G through the hood with pride (ride)
Every strip, block, and projects is on my side
I’m ghetto calm by the 100 grand on my arms (arms)
Sick watching of a 100 grand on my charm (whoo)…broke nigga

/jethro-tull/,Flying Dutchman,/jethro-tull/flying-dutchman.html,"Old lady with a barrow; life near ending
Standing by the harbour wall; warm wishes sending
children on the cold sea swell ---
not fishers of men ---
gone to chase away the last herring:
come empty home again.
So come all you lovers of the good life
on your supermarket run ---
Set a sail of your own devising
and be there when the Dutchman comes.
Wee girl in a straw hat: from far east warring
Sad cargo of an old ship: young bodies whoring
Slow ocean hobo --- ports closed to her crew
No hope of immigration --- keep on passing through.
So come all you lovers of the good life
your children playing in the sun ---
set a sympathetic flag a-flying
and be there when the Dutchman comes.
Death grinning like a scarecrow --- Flying Dutchman
Seagull pilots flown from nowhere --- try and touch one
as she slips in on the full tide
and the harbour-master yells
All hands vanished with the captain ---
no one left, the tale to tell.

So come all you lovers of the good life
Look around you, can you see?
Staring ghostly in the mirror ---
it's the Dutchman you will be
..floating slowly out to sea
in a misty misery.

Personnaly I like a lot this song. They get to fusion the didgeridoo vibes with the song very smoothly, so this is a cool tune where you don't feel the didgeridoo like an uncomfortable sound behind there.

Never there, never stay
We please ourselves, eat ourselves

Maybe we should pray

For the arrows for others
That we shoot up today
All senses are numb,
The candle grows cold
In questioning hours
All answers are sold
The bitter taste on your tongue
You wash it down with some cheap fun
The arrow cuts deeper
The cheating gets done

Deep down within - we all feel the sin
From darkness we raise - but it still hurts them too
We all save our piece - just begging: oh, please
Make it go away - all thinking `bout those who freeze outhere

It's a myth when we say:
Give love
It's meaningless, meaningless
Sounds like the croak of frogs
We preach out in the blue
But never change anything we do
Our words have no weight
And our wisdom won't do

I don't believe
In your american dream
No more, no way
It's all not what it seems
We always hear them pray
Thanking the lord for the money days
And the anger grows stronger
In those who failed the play

From darkness we raise - but it still hurts them too
We all save our piece - just begging: oh, please
Make it go away - all thinking `bout those who bleed outhere

Changing fashions, changing masquerades.
New generations, oh! with whole new conceptions.

The singing nightingale was stormed by birds of prey
If a fire broke out and ravaged every sentry

Humble streets of clay became like diamond beds
If the winds of change brought manna down
From heaven and all my priceless pearls
Should hang on golden threads

As the world keeps turning, chronic keeps burning

*Repeat*

Verse 1:Where

I flow like CD's in the deck
Moosh fools in the face that lack respect
Protect ya arm, pitch from the funk
I deodirise the musty, ya rhymes are crusty, you can't bust G
So leave me alone I'm in the zone
Walkin the streets on my own, nigga get blown
Some niggas say that nigga Where is gone
But I'm low in the cut and gotta microphone
Are you gone bust or play bones?
You motherfuckin clone, get off that nigga's style and get'cha own
It's Miscellane and it's on again
For the niggas that slept, they shoulda stayed in step
And kept ya big fuckin mouth shut

Verse 2:Where

I woke up with a stomach ache, headache, back ache
Advil, Tylenol, Peptol, slept so long realised my world is wrong
My world is gone like disco
Blowin up Cisco and in my Cammo
Standin in back of me was my soul
Thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll
Knowledge is urban-able, exhaust manifold
A tar can of hos to lubricate my system quick
Shaky bitches off the dick
Cos she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips
I'm slow but equipped with the proper tools
Show me the one talkin shit so I can drop a fool
I'm out to glow a nigga roll if he think he Mr CREAM
Come back on the scene and smoke a phillie, G
I really dream of gettin mine now let me tell you what's silly
Me, buckin with my team is murder one
I heard a gun bustin shots (SHOTS!), down the block (BLOCK!)
I guess a nigga gettin what he got (GOT!)
Shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas
I'll fuck one for y'all, they made ya last phone call
To a trick that didn't even care
Cos she was gettin fucked somewhere, you're stuck in there
Now you wanna bust, nigga, now you wanna kill, nigga (Nigga)
Nigga how ya feel? (Nigga)
You can't try to be real (You can't try to be real)
Shit is for real

Chorus

Verse 3:Where

I'm cooler than most, but I got the shorter temper
And I'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes
Let's take it back to the first side
When you was a new jack and jockin my new track
But you was wrong, didn't know about the big long
Head-strong, nicknamed Dav from off the school yard
Witta teenage group I'm turnin loots to tracks
Me and my niggas like (These tracks are laced with bomb weed and tight
lyrics)
You wanna know what the hos used to do
When me and my crew came bustin through
All sorts of blushins brew
(A neighbourhood find, a gift too swift, Miscellane is the crew)
Underground till my brown eyed balls turned blue
This is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front
I smoke on, I broke on till I spoke on
Miscellane packin shows like Farrakhan
Where is on another level with two niggas that's on the same plateau
Now that's three times your tightest flow
And three times ya tightest track, three times your fattest sack
Three times is clever (BUCK!)

We'll diarrhea up on your black ass
Babies jump out the carriage
Could even fix the Hillary and Clinton marriage

To the point where even I could make even lesbians melt
Models bookin' at me
Could even make her grandmother catch an orgasm lookin' at me (you know)

I don't tell, you don't ask
So we created a lie
And for generations
church was where we went to go hide
Or we no longer tried
Because rules without relationship is empty inside
Leaves you bitter, dry
Swift to cut like a razor
Swift to call you a traitor
Cause you're swift to love Taylor
Now we got bad blood with our neighbor

Who's wrong, who's right
Every Sunday we're divided
Who's black, who's white, C'mon
Now the man in the mirror never gets race right
He'll never be Christ-like
Never receive good pay
So your faith never rises above minimum wage
So when it's time to save the world
You don't know what to say
To your brother that you love when he tells you he's gay
Do you push him away?
Judge him down till he leaves?
Give him a gospel he hears or a gospel he sees
Love wrapped in truth is the gospel he needs
There's room at the cross for everyone, even me

Well my sins are now clean
The loss now redeemed
Religion is a prison but truth sets us free
Helps us believe
That the world we're in now
is not the world that will be
Terror, famine, disease
Millions in poverty
Hungry, can't sleep
With all of this religion
why these babies can't eat?
And if the middle class is gone, how can America see?
How can America breathe?
When the oxygen is gone from the American dream
And these American streets listen close
as they speak
The next time you think America
please include me

Help the ones that are weak
All they want is a piece
Of the pie that you keep
Is that too much to ask of those that lay the concrete?
Still laying on concrete
Pop, Pop by police
See, they're the foundation of the nation
Not the 2
Not the ones that own the building
that the middle class rent
Because they make sense

Tell me how do you feel?
I'm the new Franklin and I have the new deal
I fight and do right
Fdr for real
One nation under God
God, show us the way
The science of opinion
God is not a buffet
You pick what you want
so no God on your plate
The preacher isn't God
Religion's first mistake
Serving stewards, shepherds, not kings
Has to die to his flesh everyday like me

One Vip
All the other seats in church are free
We're just groupies
God's the celebrity
Before 313 Ad
Before Constantine
Before the Council of Nicaea
Before Romans and Greeks
Before Kalvin Alexander, Luther
Before let there be
Before history
To the last century
Before the death on the tree
Before the fall of man
Was a picture of me
Now to his heart
Right before the last three
Words he would speak
It is Finished

Can you believe?
I'm losing my religion
Thank God
Helping you lose yours
Is my job",en

It's so groovy, it's outta sight

But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet

You want it all but you can't have it

It's cryin', bleedin', lying on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it

You want it all but you can't have it
It's in your face but you can't grab it

It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad it happened and it's a shame

on the steps of the capitol
you shot a plainclothes cop on the ten o'clock
and I saw momentarily
they flashed a photograph, it couldn't be you
you'd been abused so horribly
but you were there in some anonymous room
and I recall that fall
I was working for the government
and in a bathroom stall off the National Mall
how we kissed so sweetly
how could I refuse a favor or two
for a tryst in the greenery
I gave you documents and microfilm, too

And from my ten floor tenement
where once our bodies lay
how I long to hear you say
no, they'll never catch me now
no, they'll never catch me
no, they cannot catch me now
we will escape somehow
somehow

It was late one night
I was awoken by the telephone
I heard a strangled cry on the end of the line
purloined in Petrograd
they were suspicious of where your loyalties lay
so I paid off a bureaucrat
to convince your captors they're to secret you away

And at the gate of the embassy
our hands met through the bars
as your whisper stilled my heart
no, they'll never catch me now
no, they'll never catch me
no, they cannot catch me now
we will escape somehow
somehow

And I dreamt one night
you were there in force
head held high
in uniform

It was ten years on
when you resurfaced in a motorcar
with the wave of an arm
you were there and gone

Crystal Clear
Words and Music by Chris Eaton and Paul Fields

He's the sunlight in my sky, He is the moon that shines at night
He's the rainbow over me, the river running to the sea
The music and the poetry, the beauty tha tmy eyes can see
Still His love means so much more to me

Chorus:
He's my Savior and everything within me
Wants to tell the world it's true
He's my Savior if you could open your heart
You would know Him, too

He's the fire in my soul, He melts my heart
And makes me whole
He's the air upon my breath
the gentle touch of holiness
Just for me He gave His life and
in that moment paid the price
For all I've ever done and that is why

Chorus:
He's my Savior and everything within me
Wants to tell the world it's true
He's my Savior the moment you open up your heart
You will know Him, too

Bridge:
I can take you there but I can't cross the line
It's my deepest prayer that this will be your time

I will vow, yeah
I will vow, yeah

Just for me He gave His life and in the moment paid the price
For all I've ever done and that is why

Chorus:
He's my Savior my best friend
He's my Savior He's my Savior, He saved me
He's my Savior and everything within me wants to
Tell the world it's true
He's my Savior the moment that you open up your heart
You will know Him too

/cathedral/,Empty Mirror,/cathedral/empty-mirror.html,"Chasing my own death through life
A future trapped in yesterday
When everything was fresh and bright
Then innocence found its grave

Empty mirror, soul replacer
Empty mirror, youth taker

Summer came in rays of light
Overwhelming joy it gave
Blinding all life's pain from sight
Golden days could not be saved

Empty mirror, soul replacer
Empty mirror, youth taker

In dark caves
Wisdom reigns
Awareness dulls ambition's flame
Like a corpse
In soil laid
Trust and faith long since decayed
Togetherness, broken mess
Devotion sought and found in vain

Blind fatigue debased intrigue
Love was traded in for pain
A path i followed with blind eyes
Running all this way to find
The terminal of painfull truth
Where purity and innocence died

Empty mirror, soul replacer
Empty mirror, youth taker

Dying face of beauty fades
Before my eyes as you ascend
Sail away with the sun
To never feel my touch again

Free once more to raom in hell
This lonely world represents hell
Solitude shares the pain
A secret lover til the end
I have lost the will to live
Will it come to pass?
Need the strength to carry on
Must forget the past...

The empty mirror tells no lies
Reflecting a transparent face
Just nothingless is recognised
I'm stranded in a long-lost place

Empty mirror, soul replacer
Empty mirror, i'm a stranger

Here i stand ? all alone
Before a cross my concience pleads yesterday
A thorn embraced as the future slowly bleads
Awaken now, bury the past,
Put to rest, no longer grieve
Chase the light, pass the gates
Leave this graveyard of lost dream.

After we burn a bag, I'ma hit the guts
Oh you a baller? Then ball to this
My pimps, gangstas, and dogs I ain't mad at you player, play on

Now hear me holla out GANGSTA, GANGSTA
PAPER CHASER - I love the cake
And petit mamis with the coke bottle shape
So keep shakin that money maker, ma-ma I can't hate ya
Its a cold world, ol' girl - so take advice from a pimp
What I'm spittin is venomus ism listen
When the chrome rims glistenin, on the 'llac truck
Traffic get backed up - we in this, cloud of smoke from spinach
Niggaz ain't big enough to go some rounds or minutes
I'm heavyweight, and I ain't speakin bought pounds in fitness
Use to spit off for sport but now its business
When you see me holla like you know me and I ain't scared homie
Picked up the mic, and put down the gats and yo
Now I rap and blow, with a fire acid flow
You know, and dog I ain't gotta repeat it
Right in front of ya eyes, ya see it, the best kept secret

[Verse Three]
Now everybody just (ride..)
If you sittin on dubs, in that big body rollin a bud
Then get (high..) uhh, get it crunk
(Murda.. gangster love)
Now you know its only right and necessary
that I smash Freddy, after spittin heavy - bars
Methaphors god, my shit is deadly
Swift and better believe I'm focused now
Feed you to the vultures, murderous poster child
Click, clak, BLAOW! The pound sure to drop
Then catch me full of that hall or, blowin on them poppers
But love, livin and, love them, thug, women

You're finished, diminshed ya frame get holes in it
Straight business and +No Limits+, like Master P
So if you bout that, scrilla my nilla then stack them cheese
And twist up, burn the vanilla dutch, we live it up

Wipe away the teardrop from your eye

It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize it and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension

I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night

The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin

You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...

I guard her sleep, I can do without
the fear's down deep
There's nothing good in this morning...

Oh, and I know...
invested feelings in the one I would outlast
My little friend is getting tired, fading fast...

I thought we had more time

No, I don't want to let you go
Tonight I fear I'll say goodbye to my little friend
Don't want to let you go...

I lower into the ground
my tears, forever with you
resting under your tree

you have always liked this place
it now belongs to you...
I need to set you free
and go on alone

one day in my feeble timeline
You gave me your heart and stole mine
tomorrows came too fast for me
to hear your slow, silent goodbye...

the kindest heart I've found
I lowered into the ground
your smile kept me alive
back when the skies were still

you always liked this place
now sleep under the tree
I planted here the day
when you were born

I should've been ready, seen the nearing end
my little old friend, a child.
That day I had to say goodbye and turn the bend

You hurt my pride that way Lord she stood beside me every day
So woman oh woman get out of my way

Extract from it the ""goodness""

Onto a poisoned land
Where poisoned food
Feeds poisoned minds
And we'll dump it in the waters
Where no life now knows

Staring out at the wild, blue yonder
Digging deep, I'd found buttons in my pockets
Naked now my skin begins to crawl
I dream Suits, I see Suits
Looking back, was there ever such a moment
Immersed in mystery I was witnessing a crime
Digging deep I came across a murder
Among the roots of our spreading family tree
We learned to love, we learned to kill
We taught ourselves to rule the world
I dream Suits, I see Suits
Do you see Suits, can you dream Suits?

There I stood, face pressed against the window
I know his number, but I'll never know his name
Behind the glass buried in the sockets
A recognition, my skin begins to crawl
We learned to love, we learned to kill
We taught ourselves to rule this world
But who's the one we're frightened of
We are the sons of 1470

The geese fly chevrons cross the night sky
Heading south, the hunters lead them on
Jets trail the hems of skirts of angels
A train threads along that very floor
So here we live in our bones, on the bones beneath the soil
Staring out, mortal in the darkness
Digging deep we try to find the answers
To all the questions that hatch within our skulls
We learned to love, we learned to kill
We taught ourselves to rule this world
For who's the one we're frightened of?
We are the son of 1470
I dream of Suits. Do you dream Suits?

Sure life aint the walk on the bridge,
Dam its hard as it is when i be dreaming i be talking to Big,
In my 'hood it aint a yellow brick road
We had a shot Seko sneakers hanging from a telephone pole,
And my Daddy aint no rainbow or pots of gold,
But there was love from the family when times were cold,
I sit and analyse the world from my project roof,
And seen the hope in the eyes of a troubled youth,
A good kid well kept the burning in this mother goose,
A motherless child in these streets loose,
And the more the words are raged these are rainy days,
My man got popped at an early age,
His collage friends say he flipped him to his early grave,
They say the good the young were having fun at the pearly gates.

And niggas with a lot of money, bottles in they hand
And short shirts, honies trying to show that slow (show that)
Lined up trying to get through the velvet ropes
'Cause over here when the jam drops everybody bug
Standin' on the couches like this our club
Got the Bacardi and Cristal mixed in too (yeah)
Knowin' in the morning I'm a feel the blues (uh huh)

and I'll come running to where the party at
I keep a fat sack in the backpack

In every city I'm rapping in
If it's a after splash I'm the last cat in
Get in, purrin' tight like virgin
Like snow, flurrin'
The party begins when the slurpin' ends (oh)
You do me I do you
Spend a night with boo-boo
Let's have a private party for two
But it's gotta be pumpin' in order for me to get cream
Runnin' to the border for Colombian's green
Studyin' horniculture
My green thumb keeps them water vapors twistin'

Is on the town and not alone
In his blue suit and his new tie
He slams the door without goodbye
Tonight my eyes are jealous green
Tonight I'm melancholy mean
He meets in secret rendezvous
Some dame to tell his troubles to
The heel

He'll promise her most anything
A sable coat, a diamond ring
She'll find him out when its too late
And all she'll get will be the date
But while the dawn's a distant thing
In his embrace her heart will sing
A dizzy head will spin with lies
And all too late a woman cries
The heel

The neon lights that flash below
Ignite my room with double glow
And in the gloom I hear a laugh
Its coming from his photograph
I wring my hands and mop the floor
And swear to even up the score
But where a kitten cried tonight
A panther waits to claw and bite
The heel

I dare not play my radio
One more complaint and out I go
I'm sick of playing solitaire
The ace of spades is everywhere
They'll be no sleep for me tonight
The sheep I count are never white
They all turn out to be jet black
And who's the leader of the pack
The heel

At dawn I know he'll stagger in
Demanding coffee black as sin
And as I take it from the tin
I'll slip a little powder in
He'll look at me and start to cry
And cross his heart and hope to die
And mumble I know how you feel
But I've been on a business deal
The heel

Then as the pot begins to perc.
I know my plan will never work
When he starts to drink it up
I grab his hand and break the cup
Its only jealousy I know
That brought my thinking down so low
Why must I wait for him and grieve
Why don't I just pack up and leave
The heel

But now he's reeling on the stair
I'll try to act like I don't care
For in my heart's arithmetic
I find it takes two heels to click
We're in a web of love and hate
Where it will end is up to fate
I'll let him have his little flings
I'll be the chewing gum that clings
To the heel

I never understood it myself
I reached out my hand and you just
Pushed it aside

I thought i could pick up the pieces
But i fell when i tried
I try my best to let it go
Let it fall away from me

Its hard to breathe
Underwater
And that's where i am and
I know that you
Just don't care
Cause it's where you found me

You breathe air and i breathe fire
And now i'm suffocating
I'm the victim now and you're the liar

And i just can't believe

They slowly fade away with you

I find myself fighting to keep control

Hi
I'm your video DJ
I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes
I wear a satin baseball jacket everywhere I go

My job is to help destroy
What's left of your imagination
By feeding you endless doses
Of sugar-coated mindless garbage

So don't create
Be sedate
Be a vegetable at home
And thwack on that dial
If we have our way even you will believe
This is the future of rock and roll

How far will you go
How low will you stoop
To tranquilize our minds with your sugar-coated swill

You've turned rock and roll rebellion
Into Pat Boone sedation
Making sure nothing's left to the imagination

M.T.V. Get off the
M.T.V. Get off the air
Get off the air

See the latest rejects from the muppet show
Wag their tits and their dicks
As they lip-synch on screen
There's something I don't like
About a band who always smiles
Another tax write-off
For some schmuck who doesn't care

And so it was
Our beloved corporate gods
Claimed they created rock video
Allowing it to sink as low in one year
As commercial TV has in 25
""It's the new frontier,"" they say
It's wide open, anything can happen
But you've got a lot of nerve
To call yourself a pioneer
When you're too god-damn conservative
To take real chances.

Tin-eared
Graph-paper brained accountants
Instead of music fans
Call all the shots at giant record companies now

The lowest common denominator rules
Forget honesty
Forget creativity
The dumbest buy the mostest
That's the name of the game

But sales are slumping
And no one will say why
Could it be they put out one too many lousy records?!?

From Liberty to redwood trees

In time to hear my final song

Stalks his prey for miles and miles and miles
Then barters for the merchandise
When Life it drags the likes of me around
Just when we need some time alone

Met a stranger in a foreign town,
They say the city was pretty,
They say what goes around comes back around,
And then there's a sound,
What's that sound? That, That's panic ,

She look so beautiful.

Ain't been havin' good sleep since my fathеr died

Whеn there's prophets and m**********n' poets

I'm straight from the bottom, where the floor is
Went straight through the roof, like a n**** forgot where the door is (The roof)

Slow and low - that is the tempo


It's never old school - all brand new
So everybody catch - the bugaloo flu
Not like a fever - not like a cold
The beats are clear - the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music - first things first
First of all - get off the wall
It's time to party so have a ball
Because we slowed it on down - so get the hell up
Like a volcano I'll erupt
We got determination - bass and highs
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen - nothing yet

I do not sing - but I make a Def song
You could live your whole life - and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show we won't get gonged
We're the Beastie Boys - not Cheech and Chong
Strong as an ox - fresh out the box
The crowd is so live - they're coming in flocks
And when we go on - the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock - there's nothing soft

We don't only rock the house but we'll house we rock
We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top

And we can do it like this in the place to be
When I'm recorded - you'll be rewarded
I know my song is Def 'cause you all applauded
Not P.C.P. or L.S.D. - just me Mike D. in the place to be
This is not free - you must pay a fee
Cash on delivery like a C.O.D.

The beat is slow in order to dance
I wanna hear I dos and no I can't

It's truly stable and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable

I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
The Texas blues.


Got myself in Double Trouble,
when I saw that Texas Flood.
Stevie said The Sky Is Crying,
superstition's in his blood.


I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
The Texas blues.
How-how-how-how.


Come on!


I heard that Houston Twister.
He could run you off the tracks.
When he plays that Cold Cold Feeling,
you get the shivers down your back.


I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
The Texas blues.
A-how-how-how-how.


Well, I'm going back to Dallas.
Won't go waitin' for no bus.
Ridin' off into the sunset.
You won't see my heels for dust.


I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
And I just can't lose with the Texas blues.
The Texas blues.
Texas blues.
A-how-how-how-how.

Tell me something I donâ€™t know

Take my hand, try to walk in time together

We walked the road together

[Verse I]
I see the tempetures rising
It's too hot for you to stay in there
What he's puttin you through
It doesn't fit you and it's hurtin me deeply
From the best side of town
grew up with both parents around
But your man dont know love so he can't show love I know you need it
In the beginning everything was fine
spending money on you all the time
Its never too late I'll help you escape and fly

Baby just let him go there's no tears left to cry
don't cry no more
Baby just let him go, baby let go, and baby let go
Baby just him go ain't nothin wrong with moving on to get what you want
Baby just het him go,
Baby let go and baby let go
Baby just let him go.

[Versr II]
You feeling all alone and scared
cuz you let him get in your head
He's filling your mind with all those lies
like without him your nothin
Baby dont believe a word he's gonna get what he deserves
But in the meantime just hop in my ride I'll show you what love is
Baby dont pack nothing
leave the memories and all that pain
Its never too late baby escape tonight

Yeah
It is what it is man
Uh huh

[Verse 1]
Sirens flashin', you know the routine, the crime scene taped off
It started off a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', course full of diamonds he bought
Grindin', his foot slipped off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, asked the niggas if they knew what happened
Somehow my name end up in anything that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a line up last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, thats why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, a little crack
Figure, I push it to the limit, take this shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm, fully loaded fire arm
First to let off, last to run, everytime its on

[Chorus]
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face
Cause I don't need 'em
Cause they're never around
When I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'

[50 Cent]
What, niggas yeah
Is there a mothafuckin' problem nigga
Oh yeah
That's what I thought so, pussy

[Verse 2]
niggas be talkin' about me, they always callin' me crazy
Fuck them O.G. niggas, they stuck in the eighties
Sayin' they gonna do me somethin', now you know thats a lie
nigga you look at me wrong, I'll let that hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move or get caught in the cross fire
Up a fence runnin, cut my fuckin' hand on a barb wire
Shits crazy, just a different day, its the same shit
Hollow tip part in ya head, leave ya whole fuckin' brain split
They sit, they see me in the Ashton Martin
What's the matter, they can't get that Hoopty started
Thought they was grindin', well goddamn where that money at
Thought you was fucked, cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter of fact, you's a busta
I don't trust ya, I shoulda sent niggas to touch ya

[Chorus]
I tell niggas to suck my dick
Get the fuck out my face
Cause I don't need 'em
Cause they're never around
When I'm down
Shot and I'm bleedin'

[Outro]
What?
Who said they gonna do somethin' to me
You must be out your rabbid ass mind
Fuck around and kill one of these niggas

[Lyrics: Webster, Fisher]

Repulsion of beauty drove me to hunt
A frenzy of self hate possessing me
Violated their bodies, stripped of their pride
Tortured and twisted until they have died
Hatred inside is all I would find

I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
I kill them but it's myself I hate
Now I'll do myself too
A straight razor will reshape my face
First my ears then my nose
Blood is gushing continue to carve
Erase the face I hate
Now I'm hacking at my chest
A frenzy of self hate possessed me
Controls my actions, controls my thoughts
As I scrape away at my skin

I fill my tub, with alcohol
I plunge into the burning pool
The pain intense, my whole body
Is drenched in scalding liquid
Despite my pain I am able
To grab a lighter on the counter
The flint ignites, the flames erupt
I'm consumed in the inferno
Cauterize, my skin is charred
Regenerate, more loathsome than before

I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
The abomination before my eyes
A reflection of me
I see an image of disfigured evil
I've skinned myself alive
Dripping with blood and blistered by fire
The face I hate erased

1st Verse:
Welcome to my world:
Oceans vs. Mountains
Call me the poor girl
Cause I love to fight them
But Im quite sweet,
If you take the time to get to know me.
Deep down my heart rattles around like a bone lost deep inside
See I like to fall in love, but not with that type of guy.
Ooo wee you got my clouds on fire,
Were tight rope walking and the worlds the wire
Remember kissing on Broadway, you and I?
I was being your baby and ticking and tocking your clock,
See we done jumped the broom and now youre no good.
And I was dreaming bout children, Emily Ann,
Our darling baby with her daddys eyes,
And it meant so much to me
And you know I needed your good love,
Baby how could you just go and change it all?
You turned my spring to fall
I needed you, you know,
But when the love is gone its time to go.
Hook:
If you dont think I mean it then youll feel it when Im gone
I said Im done (enough of yo love)
I said Im done (enough of yo love)
Im up to 3 oclock in the morning
While you party out til da dawn and
I said Im done (enough of yo love)

I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear

""Sounds a little Goofus to me""

I like rustic harmony

Hold a note and change the key

Not according to the rules

That you learn in music schools

But the folks just dance like fools

They sure go for "" Goofus""

Or waking up early to that four seasons breakfast
'Cause that'll screw it up like the homies down in Texas
And tell the truth, I ain't the one he tryna mess with
So keep it on the down low or whatever you call it
Before the greatest sex have me trapped in the closet
(Nah, haha) And like I said before
Girl look I'm not a hater
So if you in we can kick it like a soccer player

[Omarion]
I can be your friend
And let him be the one to take you out for dinner for two
And girl I understand
And I'll go right up out the back
Ain't gotta worry 'bout him catching youuu
Shawty you know what it is
That's if I spend the night
But I gotta be gone by the morning
But every time you talk to me
You wanna see me
I'm every now and then like an old friend

[Chorus]

Bow Wow:
I ain't tryna be rude, yeah I know you gotta dude but...
Omarion:
He ain't gotta know about me
Bow Wow:
See we could kick it in the states
Or switch countries to play it safe (You know, you know)
Omarion:
'Cause he ain't gotta know about meee
Bow Wow:
See I can come and put it down when your nigga ain't around
Omarion:
He ain't gotta, he ain't gotta, he ain't gotta
Know about meee

He ain't gotta know about the splurge on the black card
Up in Louie Vuitton and Gucci and all of that

The obscene obsession for the bling

Don't blame me for what I do
Baby, you're the cause of it all
Well you promised me your love, a love that would be true
You didn't keep your promise and I don't care what I do
You're the cause of it all
You're my down fall
Don't blame me for what I do
Baby, you're the cause of it all

Well I file my fingernails, staring at the wall
Don't wanna see my friends or anyone that comes to call
You're the cause of it all
Well, you're my down fall
Don't blame me for what I do
Baby, you're the cause of it all

My soul is wetted down with so much misery
You're the cause of it all

Don't blame me for what I do

Hailie: Daddy what are you doing?

Eminem and Hailie: Okay then! Everybody listen up!

Eminem: I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?

Hailie: Somebody please help him! I think my dad's gone crazy

There's no mountain I can't climb,
there's no tower too high,
no plane that I can't learn how to fly what do
I gotta do to get through to you,
to show you there ain't nothin'
I can't take this chainsaw to?
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls,
I cut'em off, and got'em pickled and
Bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall
with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name
on my Glaad wall,
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin'
My ass off All this time
me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall) .
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
before I push this muthafuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians and that's all blow
every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off.
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby, (My Dad's Lost It!)

There's really nothin' else to say
I... I can't explain it

A little help from Hailie Jade
Won't you tell 'em baby

There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(Hailie: I think my dad's gone crazy)

It's like my mother always told me
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana
and codeine and goddammit you little muthafucker
if you ain't got nuthin' nice to say then don't say nuthin'
·... uh, fuck that shit bitch eat a muthafuckin' dick
chew on a prick and lick a million muthafuckin' cocks
per second, I'd rather put out a muthafuckin'
Gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch,
eat pussy, and have pussy lips glued to my face with
A clit ring
in my nose then quit bringin' my flows quit givin' me
My ammo.
Can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M. O.
I wouldn't have to go, eenee, meenee, meini, mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more am
I the only fuckin' one who's
Normal any more?

My songs can make you cry,
Take you by surprise at the same time,
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
see what you're seein' is a genius at work,
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to
Misinterpret it at first cus
when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek,
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning
Twice
At once and die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on,
And kicked and hit with shit everytime
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on.
More pain inside of my brain than
The eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade,
Standin' on Ronnie's grave,
Screamin' at the sky, till clouds gather,
It's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade and
That's pretty much the gist of it, the parents
are pissed but the kids love it.
9 millimeter heater stashed
In 2 seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you,
I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

So bitch get on your knees and give me head like it's 94'
And don't come up for air 'til the beat drop
I'm the Doctors Advocate call it a sneak peak
at the mudafukn Detox, Take no?
And let the world know the west is ridin' again
I Graduated from Dre's school top of my class
Treat my switches like my bitches got me dropping that ass
Still bangin' the chronic like doggiestyle came with it
And I roll a sticky on my bitch back while I hit it
I done been there, done that, had beefs and won that
5 million records on 1 plaque I hung that
Still got Dr. Dre low ridin' in the 64'
When you see us, throw it up for the fukin' Westcoast

We pull the best weed in the Westcoast
We low ridin' in the Westcoast

My lil' hood rat, baby got that mini mack
Baby got that 20 sack, baby got plenty that
Whatever you send it's my nugga, we gonna send it back
Im in the club, with the snub, getting' love
with 20 thousand Crips and 20 thousand Bloods
And we don't give a fuck about none of ya'll
And when you hit the city, you better holla at the Big Dogg
I done seen niggas hit LA and get dey chain snatched
Then they call me up, beggin' me to get dey chain back
What I look like the mudafukin Police
It's certain rules you got to follow, when you in these streets
Especially when it comes to this Cali shit
And I ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley Bitch
Gang bang niggas all up in the alley Crip

When he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home
Shit, he about to be rockin it
Lookin sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's
Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis
Adjustin his body with telekenesis
Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft
Got in the car and dropped him off
Tryin to sink down as low as I can up in my seat
Cause I'm rollin in the Hummer and the top was off

Shoulda told the bitch use another douche
If you was at the police station, shoulda smelled like heist

[Vocal melody: Lanvall]

Where the rainbow meets the sky
In the mountains, so gleaming so high
There, the wizard spoke his rhymes
Calling back the ancient times
When magic has rules
Over earth, sea and air

Damned for years in his den
Chasing forces in this lonesome hidden glen
The black power he has never served before
Shadowed him forevermore

In the village near by
A lady spreads her beauty like a butterfly
Her golden hair is blowing in the wind
Dreaming of the wizard's fate

And the crystal ball shows salvation so soon
When wolves are howling at the moon
To break the spell and sing the tune

She's finding out the secrets full of taunting lies
Hidden in the night time skies
With white magic she allies

She came to touch the wizard's magic wand
To break the spell that frees him from his cell
The good power always will reveal

The stones they've been throwing
In that winter's snowing
The chants will be flowing
Again in fairyland
Then, magic has won
And you'll be the one
To spread the wizard's tale
The wizard
The wizard
The wizard
Just spread the wizard's tale

The orchestra played the sweetest serenade

May all their ghosts come back to haunt you
And tell you how they died

How do you feel when you close your eyes, and try and drift away?
Does it feel any better now?
Does it mean any more when the angel of death comes knock, knocking,
And banging at your door?

Took you home, away from it all
Shot down and claimed, mounted and framed
Tastefully hung up on my wall
Are my dreams your nightmares? I hope they all come true
Get off your knees, the party’s over

Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdie these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh
Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her
I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still ""long hair, don't care"" like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search
I smash this verse, and I swag and surf

No Ceilings!

And days that slip away
Some search till the end of time, but never find,
The open arms of fate
One moment comes along, someone who's a dream to you,
All at once your dreams come true

Chorus:
Once in a lifetime, you find the one you really love
For now and forever, one love that never ends
Once in a lifetime, when every star that lights the sky
Will shine with one reason, leading your heart to the one love you find
Just once in a lifetime


Some people live their lives in compromise,
And hide their dreams away
Some never take the chance, within their hands,
To claim the prize they make
When faith is all you need, to hold the hand of destiny,
Find the love that's meant to be


Chorus:


If you believe in the power of love
And you believe that dreams come true
Magic will fill your heart, when that moment comes along
Just once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime, when every star that lights the sky
Will shine with one reason, leading you home to the one love you find
Just once in a lifetime, Just once in a lifetime",en

When Johnny came home with a gift for me
He said I bought it for you because I love you
And I bought it for you because it's your birthday, too
He was so very nice, he was so very kind

I used to think of him, he used think of me
He told me to close my eyes
My gift would be a great surprise
I saw tears were in his eyes
He never meant to hurt me

There's so many ways our lives have changed
But please, I beg, don't do this to me
Johnny, don't point that gun at me
Can I save my life at any price?
For God's sake won't you listen to me?

Johnny came home with another wife
And he often remembered how it used to be
Before that special occasion, 1963
There was too many ways that you could kill someone

First class with a coach bag, I forgot
When you start eatin' you lose your hunger then grow fat
I apologize for Christians with pickets sayin', ""God hates fags""
I promise Jesus wouldn't act like that
He said it's hard for a rich man to get to heaven
When we feel like we don't need God, then we forget Him
We tell 'em that, ""If you don't make me money or make me happy
Then I ain't makin' time for ya', so make it snappy""
And I think lately you mistake me for a cabby
Cause this drive that I got put everybody in the backseat
So if you wanna live a comfortable life
Make sure you never love nobody, be selfish and never sacrifice

Alright, I was sleeping next to him
But I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did
Just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in
But so easy just to fall right back out again
This whole time, I could give to you
And I could paint you pictures
But I guess I could just never write a song
And then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him
In the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling

We were fucking homies and shit
And then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby
Goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations
Where I look like a dumbass bitch
And I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch

It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the
The queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey
You know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes
That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it person
I just bury my head in your armpit which
Weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time
That I had like a 15 minute
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit
And I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep
And that thing about the vomit

One named nina and that yapper my side bitch
We size niggas up so wisely, choose who you side with
Got something on my side, that pack of kick, that's my sidekick

Money don't make itself, these niggas gon' make me kill 'em
I should probably see a shrink, but I'm afraid he'll make me little
I've been a beast since I could remember
I got too many hoes, that's my dilemma
Chop yo' fuckin' head off and put it on the front of my car like the emblem
Get 'em, mike banger on the beat, I got this banger on display

Got a billion bitches, I'm lookin' for the one that got away
And since all these niggas watchin', ask 'em for the time of day, uh
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm skating
Got yo' hoe at the skate park waiting

That dick keep her coming back, motherfuckin' reincarnation
I don't want that pussy if it's spacious, just give me fellatio
My bitch named gigi give me head, I be like goodness gracious fuck
Hi, my name is tune, it's nice to eat ya
Yeah, I still keep that gun like a secret
Another one bites the dust, would you like to eat it?
Boy I have the people looking for you like a reason, uh
You don't want to hit my blunt, cause I been eating pussy all day

This gun got a hair trigger, I pull this bitch till it's bald head
You ain't got no bars nigga, recharge, you going dead
Can't kill me, I was born dead, crown of thorns head
Devil horns red, have my barn head
I'm a serial killer, yo' lucky charm dead
And that trash bag, they find your arm, leg, leg, leg, arm, head

Oh what a tangle, where we-we, I feel like daddy long legs
I bought that ferrari spider for my boys at rikers and all my lifers
My bitch say my dick is great, but I make her say it like tony the tiger
I own a rifle, I'm on the edge, I pop-pop and I'm ridin' off
I'm devastation, I'm freddy jason

Suddenly a child no more
All the ribbons all the bows in a box now on her closet floor
Anxious for whats to come
Afraid to leave a place she loves

Shes not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17

Broken hearts and rusted dreams
Sometimes make it hard to leave and
Certainty is out of reach even with some self belief
So she bites her lip and shows a smile
Flips her hair and flaunts her style

Shes not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17

Her memories she stowed away
Pulls them out on rainy days
And brand new faces take their place beside the ones that never fade Shes strong and fragile, weak and smart
Whatever the cost she plays the part

Shes not a woman not a girl
Trying to find her place in this crazy world
Meet a lover make a friend
Try and figure out what this life really means
After 17

Her right hand closed the front porch door
And suddenly a child no more.

Uh, your bad self
Help me break this down from off the shelf
Here's a music servin' you so use it
Papa's got a brand new funk
Get down (party for your right)
Huh, let's get it on
Like we said before
They say the brothers causin' trouble
Hate to bust their bubble
'Cause we rumble
From our lower level
To condition your condition
(We're gonna do a song)
That you never heard before
Make you all jump along to the education
Brothers gonna work it out
And stop chasin'
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out

Chorus

You got it...what it takes
Go get it...where you want it?
Come get it...get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

So many of us in limbo
How to get it on, it's quite simple
3 stones from the sun
We need a piece of this rock
Our goal indestructible soul
Answers to this quizzin'
To the Brothers in the streetSchools and the prisons
History shouldn't be a mystery
Our stories real history
Not his story
We gonna work it one day
Till we all get paid
The right way in full, no bull
Talkin', no walkin', drivin', arrivin' in style
Soon you'll see what I'm talkin' 'bout
'Cause one day
The brothers gonna work it out
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out

Let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willin'

Now we are ready if you are ready

In 1995, you'll twist to this
As you raise your fist to the music
United we stand, yes divided we fall
Together we can stand tall
Brothers that try to work it out
They get mad, revolt, revise, realize
They're super bad
Small chance a smart brother's
Gonna be a victim of his own circumstance
Sabotaged, Shellshocked, rocked and ruled
Day in the life of a fool
Like I said before to live it low
Life take you time, time yo go slow
Look here, not a thing to fear
Brother to brother not another as sincere
Teach a man how to be father
To never tell a woman he can't bother
You can't say you don't know
What I'm talkin' 'bout
But one day ... brothers gonna work it out

You got it ... what it takes
Go get it ... where you want it?
Come get it ... get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street
Are willing to work it out

Let's get it on... we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willin'

The hardest hearts break in surrender
And heaven conquers once again.

My King is alive! My King is alive!
Call me a fool for this stand, but I would die for that man.
My King is alive! My King is alive!
And He is worthy of everything.

I know I'm not the only one who felt the hands of death.
But I have found the only One who can restore this life.
I... I am convinced He can save you
Because I was once in need of a savior.

""If an individual loves God supremely, he will be as conscious that he lives for God as that he lives at all."" - Keith Green

Deliverer, deliver us.
Deliverer, deliver us.
Deliverer, deliver us.
Deliverer, deliver us.

Because He who promised is faithful.

Where meek souls will receive him still,

/public-enemy/,Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos,/public-enemy/black-steel-in-the-hour-of-chaos.html,"Ridenhour - Shocklee - Sadler - Drayton

I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn - I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...
It occured to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun - to be another one
Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime - never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize - what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up - word'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust - yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked - I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a C-O
Sleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun - then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin' - I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent -
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nuthin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who wanna get nice?
I had 6 C-Os, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious - call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose - yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't - come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up
Blew up, who shot...
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just gotaway
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone

I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my Dna
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again
Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's already shot to hell
I'm falling helplessly, I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit, every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, but definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven, but makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along, and she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay, though
'Cause I know she loves me, my friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

In my moments of weakness, I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she
Gets going, she don't stop, when I'm up, she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something 'bout her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist
Make a believer out of me
And show me the way now
Or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain
I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me

But you're the one thing

It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy, brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say ""screw her""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
This time, this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light now, I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief

Akon and Asher Roth

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
They say they want that hot shhhh, say no more
Had to walk around the block, couldn't take no more!
Like escaper from the rock, couldn't wait no more
Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword
So I'm sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce
Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours

Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor
Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war
Guessed, but I'm pretty sure that I'm destined to endure
Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore
World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
What's behind the door, the allure something strange?

Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed
No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change
Course is unphased, contorted or concave
I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang
Got me feeling like

[Hook: Akon]
I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself
I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health
When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt

Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help
So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real
So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield
Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
When friends become foes know you're doing it well

Just keep it going
I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker?
Group homes and tombstones to feel safer
Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying
Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in

Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it
Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is
Way I play the game, it's no wonder the brother made it like

Just look at me - I'm limited
And just look at you
You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda
So now it's up to you
For both of us
Now it's up to you

I've heard it said
That people come into our lives for a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led
To those who help us most to grow
If we let them
And we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you

Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good

It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have re-written mine
By being my friend
Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird
In a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you

Because I knew you

I have been changed for good

And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done you blame me for

But then, I guess we know
There's blame to share

And none of it seems to matter anymore

Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good

Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
I do believe I have been changed for the better

And because I knew you

Because I knew you

Because I knew you
I have been changed for good.

Nothin' could stop him when Jables and Kage hit the stage
And Hollywood Jack hit the big time and went to make movies
Rage Kage was left far behind in the dust of his dreams

And he grumbled and growled and watched
Hollywood Jack on Jay Leno
He bellowed and said he'd be nothing without help from Kage
He burned up the photos of Jables and Kage doin' mushrooms
Fuck him! I don't need no Hollywood Jack, anyway

So Hollywood Jack lived up high on a hill in a bubble
And Rage Kage lived deep in the broiling valley below
Yes the Rage Kage bubbled with rage
He looked at the ground and he looked on the stage
The lava was flowin' and broilin' inside the old Kage

As Hollywood Jack climbed the ladder of stardom before him
He watched as his indie credentials flew right out the door
He'd make millions and then he'd go out
and make even more millions
He'd screen Kg's calls and snort coke off the ass of a whore

No one respected him, they just rejected him
No one would represent Kage
Left on the streets of his dreams he would cry
And he'd rage, for the stage

Then Hollywood Jack got a message that Kage was in trouble
They sent Kage away cause he had gone completely insane
So Hollywood Jack jumped upon a jet plane
And flew all that night through the rain
To be with his friend, to see what remained of his brain

Then Hollywood Jack told the doctors, ""You've got to retrieve him
You've got the technology, use the techniques of your trade""
He grabbed the lapels and he screamed, ""By God, you must save him!
Because Rage Kage and I
can't you see that we're one in the same?""

Rage Kage
Rage Kage
There be magic inside that old name
And you know
That you know
When you're going completely insane
Ah, the Rage Kage
Ah, the Rage Kage
Oh, the lion will roar once again
And you know
Yes you know
When you're going completely insane

And he does not sing a thing mournful

And white opals swimming
In a child's leather purse

And the burning of Atlanta

And May ribbons streaming
And straw-colored curls a-turning

And woe to the sun
And woe to the young

I'm letting go
Don't wanna fight anymore
I need to show every side of my heart
Now I can face the night
Daring to dream again
Suddenly I'm alive

All that I am is what I was and who I'll be
Here where I stand is all I have
And what you see
Take theses empty hands
This is all I am

Till I surrendered
You never felt the wind till you run for your life

All that I am is what I was and who I'll be

You make me feel happy
Happy, happy to know you

But where is the feeling?
The feeling of security
When we're not together
Tell me everything's gonna be alright
It's just no use, can't get over you

Anytime you want me to
I can make you happy
(I can make you happy)
There ain't nothing I wouldn't do (anytime)
To make you happy

Tell me I'm crazy
Maybe since you've been gone

Together we're one

Additional lyrics from Bir Soundtrack Mix

Love, trust, monogamy
Isn't that How it's supposed to be?
Isn't that How it's supposed to be?

When we're not together
Tell me everything will be alright

When we're not together
Tell me everything will be alright

When we're not together
I wanna know things will be alright

Tell me everything will be alright

So why do I still feel this way?
Detached and vulnerable
With the world on my shoulders
Left alone to face the unknown
With just a wish for what it's worth

Why is it that the very thing
that bonds us together
is also what drives us apart?

If only I could laugh in the face of irony
Safe in the knowledge of our eternal love
Is that really too much to ask?

Love me, hold me
Comfort and reassure me
Tell me everything'll be alright

Touch me, need me
Listen and understand me
Tell me everything'll be alright

Just tell me everything's gonna be alright",en

Looking out for a place to go

With a bit of rock music

You cannot tell me you're so strong...

Just let me ask of you one small thing

With ferver our dreams we planned a whole life long
Now are scattered on the wind...

In the terms of the life that you love
In the terms of the years that pass you by
In the terms of the reasons why

Through the years I've grown to love you
Though your commitment to most would offend
But I stuck by you holding on with my foolish pride
Waiting for you to give in...

You never really tried, or so it seems
I've had more than myself to blame
I've had enough of trying everything
And this time it is the end...

In the terms of endearment
In the terms of the life that you love
In the terms of the years that pass you by
In the terms of the reasons why

There's no more coming back this way
The path is overgrown and strewn with thorns
They've torn the life blood from your naked eyes
Cast aside to be forlorn...

In the terms of the life that you love
In the terms of the years that pass you by
In the terms of all the reasons why

Seemed to make no difference to you at all...

Indiscreet - it's indiscreet
To gaze at you - each time we meet
I've told my eyes - they must disguise - this yearning

Yes it's indiscreet - quite indiscreet
To find your touch - so bitter sweet
You're close to me and suddenly I'm burning

While I ask myself: ""Where is your pride?""
Irresistibly I'm drawn to your side

And (Yes) it's indiscreet - so indiscreet
But love is swift - and time is sweet
And oh my dear - I crave the nearness of you

To love you is why my heart must be
So love me - it can't be indiscreet

From feeling my life pass by always out of touch

So I found my way and I swear I don't know what
To say to the boy who looks in the mirror
I've reached for so much and failed
I never let go of this growing weight in my chest
I really thought this walk was meant
To make any sense, but to make me small
I really thought being a man wouldn't feel like
A boy with missing thoughts, with missing time

Stuck on the road again, I just know how to walk
And if it's the sense of life, well, I did my part
It takes so much from me, eats me from the heart
But I still know how to dream

I still know a boy who never learned to give up
Running with a dusty heart in his hands
Trying hard to show life he is never scared
And as long as he's still there
He will never leave the road

Verse Two: Q-Tip

Where ya at? To all my peoples with the funk
I'm the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk
Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggaz step up it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paper back books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excelling cuz I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo I gets the pickens, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link on the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mardane
See I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah I can do that
I can also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
Cuz when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind
Makes me pick up and go when it's time to drop a rhyme
My title is locked, the Abstract poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, especially for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear cuz it's evident and clear
That I will rock, rock, rock [fades away]

Where the pillars of stone bar the path to all who try

The screams of the past echo in the halls
Now the wizards arise from their watchtower in the sky

Onwards through the cold lands over endless nights and days

Through the swamps of sadness and through forests stripped of light

She doesn't care a thing about that hair
She thinks I'm beautiful

She never compromises
Loves babies and suprises
Wear high heels when she excersizes
Ain't that beautiful?
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mamma works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator for the President

Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me, hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home and rip on the President
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her life
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna live this life

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite unusual
You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body - unusual

Meet Virginia-I can't wait to
Meet Virginia-Yea

Now take a look around this spot

I'm seeing every detail like an over-cranked camera
Sleestaks in the back say 'Damn ya'
You say 'I can't' and I say 'Why can't ya?'
Chopping the track in the-in the land of...

You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this

Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this

Take a look around you

There's a bird in here
That's my DJ, not Doctor Brassiere
Dropping bombs like a bombardier
Like cacao, it's a chocolatier

We're giving y'all a lil slice of heaven
B Boys bringing it back to A7
Deal with the schism, ride on the rhythm
Sweet like pie and the pie's what I give 'em

I'll stage a coup and usurp your position
'Cause-'cause like a Mormon, I'm on a mission
We're audible-visible
Cadence is lyrical
Got the mental and physical
When the moment is critical

You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

Ruff!
Uh, Lee Majors come again

Like the Six Dil- Million Dollar Man
Woo! Watch out!
In the back of the bus...gonna bust!
Lee Majors style

I said stop! Watch how I flip
Bill Piedmont with the Kung-Fu grip
Haymaker, roundhouse, show can't continue
At the roller rink down in Virginia

Oh, yeah, did I spill the beans?
I see your grandpa in Apple Bottom jeans
A Von Dutch cap, Ugg boots to match
The word gets out, you can't take it back

I'm just a pause tape competition expert winner
Just a doggone, long-armed, tall yarn spinner
You want a battle? Easy now, star
My DJ's so nasty, he needs a sneeze guard

You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this

The only way to gain,
A lot of things are just a lie
This world we love comes down in pain
With hate and bloody games
A question-mark up in the sky

Look, you can't keep away

Tomorrow, yesterday, today...

Some people say, we'll do it better
Some people say, everything's good
Some people sing, let's come together

Don't grab that scabby hand
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell
It belongs to the candyman

Don't whore your little bodies
The worms of paradise
Like Everest it's fatal
It's peaks are cold as ice

They're riding on the subways
They're riding on the streets
They'll ride you down to the gutters
They'll ride you off your feet

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

Yeah piss on the icon monsters
Whose guitars bequeath you pain
They'll face you down to their level
With their addictions and their fast lanes

Corrupt with shaky visions
And crack and coke and alcohol
They're just a bunch of assholes
With buttholes for their brains

You can't keep on riding
Pain you know so well
They'll ride you down to the gutter
And they ride you down to hell

Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

And you the master dealer
May death be on your brow
May razors slash your mainline
I'm calling you out right now

May all your vilest nightmares
Consume your shrunken head
May the ho-ho-hoounds of paranoia
Dance upon your stinking bed

Don't look at me you fuckhead
This nation's turning blue
It's stink it fouls the highways
It's filth it sticks like glue

Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

Hit Carck City

They'll bury you in velvet
And place you underground
The hatred of yourself
And the sufferings that conspire
To take your little body and throw it to the
fools

And the hounds that rip your flesh
Only your mind can take you out of this
Only your mind or death

I'm riding on the subway
The subway down to hell
I've finished with this journey
Oh I seem to know it well

Oh Gonna hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City
Hit Crack City

/maroon/,Without A Face,/maroon/without-a-face.html,"Starring at the white ceiling.
Being thrown back into the end of days.
The gentle men will take revenge!

Trying to cut the scum off this world.
The sober blade- lunatic's fate.
This will to cleanse can't be ignored!

Waste away with poisoned veins.
Senses fade and the hate awakes!
Love kills in persistence!

Barely remembering these winter days.
But the nights I left without a trace.
""Catch me when you can!""

THIS SHINING BLADE - NO MORE - IMPURITY!
THIS IS MY FATE - THIS IS - MY DESTINY!
FROM HELL!
WITHOUT A FACE!

Deep wounds cut in delusion.
Warm blood over cold hands.
""My Heart is colder still!""

Disappointment and disillusion.
Mutilation as the one relief.
And cries remain unheard!

Am I victim or the cruel offender?
Do you feel remorse or just contempt?
Does anybody understand?

I looked them in the frightened eyes.
I felt the death of their final breath.
Mary Jane! Take me away!

THIS SHINING BLADE - NO MORE - IMPURITY!
THIS IS MY FATE - THIS IS - MY DESTINY!
FROM HELL!
WITHOUT A FACE!

Fear I'm spreading with my instruments.
Ripped apart and left wide open...

THIS SHINING BLADE - NO MORE - IMPURITY!
THIS IS MY FATE - THIS IS - MY DESTINY!
FROM HELL!
WITHOUT A FACE!
