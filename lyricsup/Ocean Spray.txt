18 ContributorsOcean Spray Lyrics
Smokin' and I'm sippin'
I'm smokin' and I'm sippin' (MacTooBangin)
I'm chillin' with your bitch, mane
Smokin' and I'm sippin', sippin'

The coupe came with a masseuse (What that mean?)
That mean the seats massage me (Where you at?)
Out of sight, but I'm still in the loop (Doin' what?)
Callin' shots in the bed with a Barbie (Boss)
If they try me in here, I'ma shoot (Baow)
Fuck around and forget I'm an artist (Fuck it)
In this Sprite, I'ma pour up a deuce (Wock')
Twenty-eight for a pint, what they charge me (Taxin')
Can't leave the streets 'cause I'm deep in (Deep in)
'Posed to be savin', I keep spendin' (Keep goin')
I told my bitch, she can't be friendly (Nah, nah)
She call me daddy, might depend (Parent)
When she want it, she demand it (Uh-uh)
She a lil' savage like Randy (Demon)
Neck full of water, Titanic (Sinkin')
Flyin' then you out here landin' (Go)
Everything purple, I do it for Nuski
That was my hitter, my dawg, my Scooby
An eight of Wockesha, the bottle look gooey
I done got high to the point I look stupid
Drivin' the 'Rari, today, I feel coupie
You with a street nigga, stop actin' bougie
You say you love me, then make sure I'm good
You say you ridin', then that's over-stood
I left some real niggas in the hood
I'd bring 'em all with me if I could
Don't see 'em with me no more, then they blew it
Won't fuck with nobody more than I should
This a new piece, yesterday's ice not today's ice (Look)
One show cost a two-piece
Yesterday's price's not today's price (Big bag, hey)

I'm juiced up (I'm juiced up)
Ocean Spray (Ocean Spray)
I'm poured up (I'm poured up)
Let's drink some more today (Some more of the lean)
I'm high now, might float away if I was outside now (Outside now)
I'm vibed out, new Cartiers hide my eyes now (My eyes)
Some members gon' pull up and wet you up, brrt (What's that?)
Ocean Spray (Ocean spray)
Don't give a fuck where you catch him at (Anywhere)
He gotta go today (Go today)
Let's ride now, let's load shit up and go slide now (Then slide now)
Can't hide now, when they walk down, bustin' that fire now (Bop)

Do you know how it feel to come from nothin'? (Shit)
Starvin', your stomach and back is touchin' (Strugglin')
Them niggas ain't me, that's another subject (Nah)
These bitches love me 'cause they know I'm thuggin' (That's for sure)
Told me she cry every night 'bout me, I barely tell her "Thank you," I don't appreciate her (Appreciate her)
I just wan' burn your head, yeah, cremation, baby, I don't want your relations (Haha)
I want, then I don't want it, stop, then I'm back on it, every day, I'm fightin' temptations (Man)
Kept it one-hundred, stay humbled then hustled, then turned into a global sensation (Big speaker)
I'm smoking Backwoods, countin' up backends, so far, I counted up one-twenty (Buck twenty)
Switches and Dracos, Glock-10, FN, I want all smoke, four-twenty (Go 'head, try)
I'm juiced up (I'm juiced up)
Ocean Spray (Ocean Spray)
I'm poured up (I'm poured up)
Let's drink some more today (Some more of the lean)
I'm high now, might float away if I was outside now (Outside now)
I'm vibed out, new Cartiers hide my eyes now (My eyes)
Some members gon' pull up and wet you up, brrt (What's that?)
Ocean Spray (Ocean spray)
Don't give a fuck where you catch him at (Anywhere)
He gotta go today (Go today)
Let's ride now, let's load shit up and go slide now (Then slide now)
Can't hide now, when they walk down, bustin' that fire now (Bop, bop)1Embed
