Trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby

Picture a place where it all doesn't hurt
Where everything's safe and it doesn't get worse, oh my
We see through bloodshot eyes
Picture a place, somewhere else far away
Where you know what they mean and they mean what they say to us
And would that be enough?

Are we running out of time?
Are we hiding from the light?
Are we just too scared to fight for what we want tonight?

Closе your eyes and leavе it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby
You and I and everyone alive
We can run into the fire
It's a trust fall, baby
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby

Jump with me, come with me, burn like the sun
We'll talk, then we'll cry, then we'll laugh 'til we're done, oh my
It's like we're out our minds

We've been running for our lives
We've been hiding from the light
We've been far too scared to fight for what we want tonight

Close your eyes and leave it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby
You and I and everyone alive
We can run into the fire
It's a trust fall, baby
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby

What if we just fall?
I'm not going without you
You're not going alone
I fell so far 'til I found you
But you know what you know when you know
So I'm not going without you
You're not going alone
'Cause you know when you know
Close your eyes and leave it all behind
Go where love is on our side
It's a trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby

What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just fall?
What if we just—1Embed
