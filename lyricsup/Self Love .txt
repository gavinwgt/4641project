(Metro)
Yeah
Mmm

Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin’ now
Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Long way, really long way from suburbia

Small town love, fall down love, not medicated
Drink too much, think too much, thoughts drownin' me
I’m too high, please don't cry, stop doubtin' me
You don't know love, you just show love, stop downin' me

Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don’t trust mе

Oh my, she’s a long way from suburban towns
Came to the city for thе love, got her hurtin' now
Oh my, she’s a long way from suburban towns
Long way, really long way from suburbia
